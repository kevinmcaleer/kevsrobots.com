Work on learning pathway; also work on content for a new video series, also tie in with Book chapters

## **"MicroPython Projects: From Code to Creation"**

**Video 1: "[[01 Talking to the World – Working with I2C and SPI-2]]"** Cover the two most common communication protocols. Use a practical example like reading an I2C sensor (BME280 or similar) and displaying data. Demystify addresses, scanning for devices, and reading datasheets.

**Video 2: "[[02 Adding a Display – OLED Screens with MicroPython]]"** Connect an SSD1306 OLED, draw text, shapes, and simple graphics. Build a live sensor readout from Video 1. Great visual payoff for viewers.

**Video 3: "[[03 Going Wireless – WiFi and Web Servers on Pico W]]"** Connect to WiFi, make HTTP requests, and create a simple web server to control an LED or display sensor data remotely. Covers the `network` and `socket` modules.

**Video 4: "[[04 Saving Your Data – Files, JSON, and Data Logging]]"** Write sensor readings to files, work with JSON for configuration, and build a simple temperature logger that survives power cycles.

**Video 5: "[[05 Smooth Moves – PWM, Servos, and Motor Control]]"** PWM fundamentals, controlling servo positions, and basic DC motor control with a driver board. Sets up nicely for robotics.

**Video 6: "[[06 Putting It All Together – Build a WiFi Weather Station]]"** Capstone project combining sensors, display, WiFi, and data logging. Viewers get a complete, useful project they can show off.

## **Bonus Episodes: "MicroPython Meets IoT"**

**Video 7: "[[07 Introduction to MQTT – Publish, Subscribe, and Brokers]]"** Explain the pub/sub model, set up a Mosquitto broker (locally or via a free cloud broker), and send your first messages between a Pico W and a laptop. Keep it conceptual but hands-on.

**Video 8: "[[08 Building an MQTT Sensor Node]]"** Take the weather station from Video 6 and convert it to publish sensor data via MQTT. Show how multiple devices can subscribe to the same topics.

**Video 9: "[[09 Connecting to Home Assistant]]"** Integrate your MicroPython device with Home Assistant using MQTT discovery. Viewers get their DIY sensor appearing in a real dashboard – huge "wow factor."
