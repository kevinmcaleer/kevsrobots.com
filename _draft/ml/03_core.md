## Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

In this section, we discuss the two main types of machine learning:

- **Supervised Learning:** where the model is trained on a labeled dataset that includes both input and output parameters.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** where the model works with unlabeled data and aims to identify underlying structures or patterns.

## Classification, Regression, and Clustering

We'll explore the three common types of machine learning tasks:

- **Classification:** Categorizing data into predefined classes.
- **Regression:** Predicting continuous values.
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points together.

## Evaluation Metrics and Data Splitting

Understanding how to evaluate the performance of a machine learning model is crucial. We'll cover key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for classification, and mean squared error for regression. We'll also discuss the importance of splitting data into training and testing sets.

In the next lesson, we will focus on a specific machine learning algorithm - Linear Regression - and implement it in Python.
