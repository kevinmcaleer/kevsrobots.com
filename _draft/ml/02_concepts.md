## Understanding Data: Types and Sources

Data is the cornerstone of machine learning. In this section, we will explore different types of data (numerical, categorical, time-series, etc.) and their sources. We'll also discuss how to collect and preprocess data for machine learning.

---

## Basic Statistics and Data Analysis

A fundamental understanding of statistics is essential for machine learning. We'll cover basic statistical concepts like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. We'll also introduce data analysis techniques to explore and understand datasets.

---

## Introduction to Python for Machine Learning

Python is a versatile language widely used in machine learning. This section will provide an introduction to Python, focusing on its applications in machine learning.

---

### Python Basics

We'll start with Python basics, including syntax, data types, and control structures.

---

### Key Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Pythonâ€™s strength lies in its libraries. We'll introduce:

- NumPy for numerical computing
- Pandas for data manipulation and analysis
- Matplotlib for data visualization

In the next lesson, we will dive into the core principles of machine learning, covering topics like supervised vs. unsupervised learning, classification, regression, and clustering.
