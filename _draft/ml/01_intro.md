## What is Machine Learning?

`Machine learning` ([`ML`](/resources/glossary#machine-learning)) is an exciting subfield of artificial intelligence that empowers systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. This is achieved through algorithms that adapt and improve their performance as they process more data.

Example: Consider a machine learning algorithm designed to identify spam emails. Initially, it might make several mistakes, but as it processes more data (i.e., emails), it learns and becomes more accurate in its predictions.

## A Journey Through Machine Learning History

The journey of machine learning began in the mid-20th century, rooted in the idea that machines can learn from and act upon data:

- **1950s**: Alan Turing's work on the concept of a "learning machine."
- **1960s**: The development of the nearest neighbor algorithm, setting the stage for pattern recognition.
- **1980s**: The emergence of decision tree algorithms, pivotal in the evolution of machine learning.
- **21st Century**: The rise of deep learning, powered by advances in computational power and data availability.
