## Understanding Docker

In this lesson, we introduce `Docker`, a platform that has changed the way software is developed and deployed.

### What is Docker?

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

### Why Use Docker?

- **Consistency**: Docker ensures that your application works seamlessly in any environment.
- **Simplicity**: Simplifies configuration management.
- **Isolation**: Containers are isolated from each other and the host system.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale up or scale down applications.

### Docker vs. Virtual Machines

- Docker containers are more lightweight than virtual machines.
- Containers share the host systemâ€™s kernel, while VMs require a full-blown OS.
- Docker can start up containers quickly compared to VMs.
