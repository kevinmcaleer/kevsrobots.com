1. Lets Create the Symbol next

    [![Outline](assets/pcb27.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb27.jpg)

1. Lets give it a name, type: RASPBERRY_PI_PICO_W

    [![Outline](assets/pcb28.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb28.jpg)

    Lets draw the Pin pads (the parts we solder to, we need 20 on each side)

1. Click the Pin Button to start placing Pins

    [![Outline](assets/pcb29.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb29.jpg)

1. Draw 20 pins in a column, 2 grid units apart.

    [![Outline](assets/pcb30.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb30.jpg)

    Next, lets draw the outline of our board, its 10 grid units wide:

1. Use the Line tool to draw a rectangle

    [![Outline](assets/pcb32.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb32.jpg)

1. Place the remaining 20 Pins on the right hand side, after clicking the Pin button, click the Rotate button to rotate it 180 degrees:

    If you miss place a symbol, there is a small + sign in the centre of the symbol, click once to select it and then drag it to the correct place.

1. Lets correctly name out Pins now using the Name tool:

1. For each Pin, Click the small Circle and name it according to the Pico Pinouts:

    Ok, lets create the footprint

1. Click the New Footprint button

    [![Outline](assets/pcb36.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb36.jpg)

1. Give it a name ‘Rasperry_Pi_Pico_W’

    [![Outline](assets/pcb37.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb37.jpg)

1. Click the PTH Pad which stands for Plated Through-Hole button and start placing the pads similar to what we did on the symbol

    [![Outline](assets/pcb38.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb38.jpg)

    [![Outline](assets/pcb39.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb39.jpg)

1. Click save and name the file: RASPBERRY_PI_PICO_W

    [![Outline](assets/pcb40.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb40.jpg)

    Now lets create the Package

1. Click Create new Package

    [![Outline](assets/pcb41.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb41.jpg)

1. Right Click on the 3 dots next to the Footprint ‘Raspberry Pico W’, then select create new 3d model

    [![Outline](assets/pcb42.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb42.jpg)

1. You’ll see a new 3d model design open up, with the Pads we created in the footprint visible. Lets bring in a Pico W Model

    [![Outline](assets/pcb43.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb43.jpg)

    > If you have the Raspberry Pi Pico W 3d model you can import it into the 3d Model at this point, if you don’t have it, head over to RaspberryPi.com, click on Pico from the Hardware page, and then scroll down to the Documents section and then click the PicoW Step file to download it

    [![Outline](assets/pcb44.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-05 shadow-lg rounded-3"}](assets/pcb44.jpg)

    Unzip the file, then Upload to Fusion 360 using the File Upload button

    Once you’ve located downloaded step file complete the upload dialog.

    I notice that the origin of the pads isn’t correct, lets go back and correct that

1. Click Finish

1. Double click on the Raspberry Pi Pico W from the Footprint panel:
