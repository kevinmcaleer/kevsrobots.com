## Overview

In this lesson, you will learn how to prepare custom object detection datasets for training object detection models. You will learn how to collect images, annotate objects in images, and create a dataset for training object detection models. By the end of this lesson, you will have a custom dataset that you can use to train your object detection models.

## Objectives

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

- Collect images for your custom object detection dataset
- Annotate objects in images using annotation tools
- Create a dataset for training object detection models

## Collecting Images

The first step in preparing a custom object detection dataset is to collect images of the objects you want to detect. You should collect a diverse set of images that represent the different variations of the objects in different environments and lighting conditions. The more diverse your dataset, the better your model will be able to generalize to new images.

When collecting images, make sure to capture the objects from different angles, distances, and orientations. You should also capture images of the objects in different backgrounds and lighting conditions to make your dataset more robust.

## Annotating Objects

After collecting images, the next step is to annotate the objects in the images. Annotation involves drawing bounding boxes around the objects in the images and labeling them with the corresponding class labels. The annotations provide the ground truth information that the model will use to learn to detect objects in images.

There are several annotation tools available that you can use to annotate objects in images, such as LabelStudio, LabelImg, and VGG Image Annotator. These tools allow you to draw bounding boxes around objects in images and save the annotations in a format that can be used for training object detection models.

For this tutorial we will use LabelStudio. You can install LabelStudio using the following command:

```bash
pip install imglabel
```

> If you have any issues running the version of imglabel from pip, you can download the source code from the [official repository](https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg) and run it locally.
>
> ```bash
> git clone https://github.com/HumanSignal/labelImg
> cd labelImg
> python setup.py install
>
> Note you may have to build the qt5py3 library from source to get it to work;
> ```bash
> make qt5py3
> ```

## Creating a Dataset

Once you have collected images and annotated the objects in the images, the final step is to create a dataset for training object detection models. The dataset should contain the images and annotations in a format that can be used by the training script to train the model.

The dataset should be split into training and testing sets. The training set will be used to train the model, while the testing set will be used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. The dataset should be organized in a directory structure that separates the images and annotations for each set.

For example, the dataset directory structure could look like this:

```

dataset/
    train/
        image1.jpg
        image1.xml
        image2.jpg
        image2.xml
        ...
    test/
        image1.jpg
        image1.xml
        image2.jpg
        image2.xml
        ...

```

In this structure, the `train` directory contains the training images and annotations, while the `test` directory contains the testing images and annotations. Each image is paired with an annotation file that contains the bounding boxes and class labels for the objects in the image.
