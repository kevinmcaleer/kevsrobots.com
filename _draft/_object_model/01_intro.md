## Overview

Welcome to the Building Object Detection Models with Raspberry Pi AI Camera course.

In this course, you will learn how to build object detection models using the Raspberry Pi AI Camera and Pytorch. You will learn how to train your own custom object detection models using the Pytorch framework, and deploy them on the Raspberry Pi AI Camera to detect objects in real-time.

## Course Content

This course is divided into the following lessons:

1. Introduction to Object Detection
2. Setting up the Raspberry Pi AI Camera
3. Training Custom Object Detection Models
4. Deploying Object Detection Models on the Raspberry Pi AI Camera
5. Real-time Object Detection with the Raspberry Pi AI Camera
6. Advanced Object Detection Techniques
7. Recap and Review

Each lesson will cover a specific topic related to building object detection models with the Raspberry Pi AI Camera. By the end of this course, you will have a good understanding of how object detection works, how to train your own custom object detection models, and how to deploy them on the Raspberry Pi AI Camera.

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this course, you should have some basic knowledge of Python programming and machine learning concepts. You should also have a Raspberry Pi AI Camera and a Raspberry Pi board with the necessary software installed.
