## Did you know Viam was founded by the creator of MongoDB?

`Viam` is an innovative robotics platform designed to streamline the transformation of creative ideas into functional, production-ready robots. Established in 2020 by Eliot Horowitz, who is also the co-founder of MongoDB, Viam has its headquarters in New York City. Horowitz brings a rich experience from his 13-year tenure at MongoDB where he developed the fundamental code base and spearheaded the engineering and product teams in his role as CTO.

Viam offers a practical solution to start building any robot, using any hardware of your choice and in any programming language you prefer. It provides a one-stop platform that enables users to configure, build, program, manage, and scale their robotic fleets. Not only that, it empowers users to perform more functions with their robotic fleets in the cloud. With Viam, your code has the flexibility to operate on the robot, in the cloud, or any other preferred location. Remarkably, all Viam services are designed to maintain functionality even in conditions with excellent, poor, or extended periods without connectivity.

By lowering the barriers to entry in the field of robotics, Viam is drawing talent and funding to the sector, encouraging more people to engage with robots to create products and services that enhance our world.
