## Setup your Raspberry Pi

Viam works best on the Raspberry Pi 4, though the Raspberry Pi 3+ is also supported. You will need to install the 64bit version of the Raspberry Pi OS.

1. Download the Raspberry Pi Imager from <https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/>, and launch it
1. Click the `Choose OS` button
