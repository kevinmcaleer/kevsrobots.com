## Overview

This document tracks the systematic review and improvement of all courses in `/source` to ensure they meet KevsRobots.com quality standards as defined in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Standards Checklist

Each course must have:

### Critical Requirements (Must Fix):
- ✅ File naming: Start with `00_intro.md`, sequential numbering
- ✅ Intro structure: Overview, Course Content, Key Results, What you'll need, How it works
- ✅ Prerequisites and "What's Next" sections
- ✅ No typos or errors in code/frontmatter

### High Priority (Significantly Improves Quality):
- ✅ "Try it Yourself" sections in coding lessons
- ✅ "Common Issues" sections with bullet-point format:
  ```markdown
  - **Problem**: Description
  - **Solution**: How to fix
  - **Why**: Root cause explanation
  ```
- ✅ Real-world context and explanations for code
- ✅ Inline code examples instead of just GitHub Gists

### Medium Priority (Enhances Learning):
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation
- ✅ Progressive complexity
- ✅ Visual aids and diagrams

## Established Patterns

### Intro Template

Every `00_intro.md` must include:

```markdown
## Overview
[2-3 paragraphs about the course and what students will build/learn]

## Course Content
- [Bullet list of topics covered]

## Key Results
After completing this course, you will be able to:
- [Bullet list of skills/outcomes]

## What you'll need
[Table or list of hardware/software requirements]

## How the course works
[Explanation of lesson format, code examples, conventions]

## Prerequisites
[What students should know before starting]

## What's Next
After completing this course, try:
- [Links to related courses]
```

### Common Issues Format

```markdown
## Common Issues

- **Problem**: Description of the issue
- **Solution**: Steps to resolve it
- **Why**: Explanation of root cause

- **Problem**: Next issue
- **Solution**: Fix steps
- **Why**: Root cause
```

### Try it Yourself Format

```markdown
## Try it Yourself

1. **Exercise Name**: Description with specific task

2. **Another Exercise**: Builds on previous knowledge

3. **Challenge**: More difficult extension

**Advanced Challenge**: Optional difficult task for motivated learners
```

---

## Process Workflow

For each course:

1. **Use course-architect agent** to review course structure and quality
2. **Fix critical issues first:**
   - File naming (00_intro.md)
   - Intro structure
   - Code bugs/typos
3. **Add interactive elements:**
   - Try it Yourself sections
   - Common Issues sections
4. **Enhance explanations:**
   - Replace Gists with inline code
   - Add "How it works" and "Why this matters"
5. **Build and verify:** `source .venv/bin/activate && python build.py`
6. **Update this document**

---

## Notes and Insights

### Common Issues Found So Far:

1. **File naming:** 2/3 courses started with `01_intro.md` instead of `00_intro.md`
2. **Intro structure:** 3/3 courses missing required sections
3. **GitHub Gists:** Many courses rely solely on Gists without inline explanations
4. **Code bugs:** Python case-sensitivity issues (`true` vs `True`)
5. **Typos:** Frontmatter paths, dates, spelling errors common

### What Works Well:

1. **Project-based learning:** All courses have clear end goals
2. **Visual content:** Assembly guides with photos are excellent
3. **Parts lists:** Comprehensive BOMs with prices
4. **Progressive structure:** Courses build logically from simple to complex

### Recommendations for Future Reviews:

1. **Prioritize courses with code** - More likely to have bugs
2. **Check Python syntax carefully** - Case sensitivity, indentation
3. **Verify frontmatter paths** - Common source of errors
4. **Test code examples** - If possible, verify they actually work

## CLAUDE.md Updates Made

- ✅ Updated "Common Issues" example to use bullet-point format
- ✅ Added second example showing proper format with multiple issues
- ✅ Format now documented for future course-architect agent use

## How to Continue

When resuming this work:

1. Read this document to understand progress
2. Review the "Next Course to Review" section
3. Use the course-architect agent with this prompt template:

```
Review the course located at `/Users/kev/Web/kevsrobots.com/source/[COURSE_NAME]/`

Evaluate against KevsRobots.com Course Content Guidelines (found in CLAUDE.md).
Focus on: file naming, intro structure, real-world examples, interactive elements,
tone, Common Issues (bullet format), and Try it Yourself sections.

Return detailed findings with actionable recommendations.
```

4. Follow the "Process Workflow" above
5. Update this document with results
6. Move to next course alphabetically
