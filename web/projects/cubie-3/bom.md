## Tools and Materials

For this project I used two colours of PLA filament (white and Yellow) for a total of 84g of filament used, a soldering iron, solder, wire cutters/strippers, M3 screws & nuts and a screwdriver.

## Heatset insert

The nuts can be secured in place into the 3d printed parts using a soldering iron to heat the nut up and pressing it into the plastic. 

Be careful not to overheat the plastic as it can deform, and burning plastic can be dangerous to touch and can give off fumes.
