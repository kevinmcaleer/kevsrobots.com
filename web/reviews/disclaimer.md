I care about transparency and being upfront about my biases or conflicts of interest. I want to be clear about how I write my reviews and what you can expect from them.

To support the work I do I occasionally use affiliate links in my reviews. This means that if you click through and make a purchase, I will earn a commission at no extra cost to you. I will only ever use affiliate links for products that I have used and can recommend.

I do not accept payment for reviews. I do occasionally receive products for free in exchange for a review, however my thoughts are always my own, and I rarely agree to accept a product I'm not personally interetested in. I will always disclose this in the review.

## Review scoring

First, each product is scored out of 5 for each of the 9 areas. The total score is then calculated by adding the scores for each area and dividing by 9. The total score is then rounded to the nearest whole number.

The 9 areas of scoring are:

- Price
- Ease of use
- Functionality
- Availability
- Aesthetics
- Build quality
- Documentation
- Packaging
- Environmental

## Transparency icons

To increase the transparency of my reviews, I use the following icons to indicate the type of review:

- üí≥ - I purchased this product myself
- üéÅ - I received this product for free
- üí∞ - I received payment for this review
- ü§ù - I have an affiliate relationship with this product

Maintaining a blog of this size involves significant time and financial investment. To support this, I charge a publishing fee for reviews. This fee compensates for the time dedicated to each article and ensures that my content is not influenced by affiliate programs. The fee arrangement is settled before I begin my work and does not affect the review's impartiality, except in the case of sponsored or ad content. In such instances, I may be required to highlight certain features and functionalities of the product.
