# Stats Dashboard Blog Images

This directory contains images for the stats dashboard blog post.

## Required Images:

1. **cover.jpg** - Main cover image for the blog post

## Tips for Screenshots:

- Take screenshots when the dashboard has interesting data

- Consider using a light mode for better contrast
- Ensure text is readable at thumbnail size
