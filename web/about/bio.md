## About Kevin McAleer

Hi, and thanks for taking an interest in what I do!
I'm a hobbyist robotics fanatic who likes to build robots, share videos about them on YouTube and teach people how to do the same, or as I say on every video:

> ***'Learn with me as we Build Robots, bring them to life with code, and have a whole load of fun along the way'***.

I live in the UK (up North), with my beautiful wife, 2 Chihuahuas and way too many cats.
