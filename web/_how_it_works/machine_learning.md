`Machine learning` is a type of artificial intelligence ([AI](/resources/glossary#ai)) that enables computer systems to learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

The core idea behind machine learning is to allow computers to learn from experience and improve their performance on a task without explicitly being programmed.

Machine learning algorithms use statistical techniques to uncover patterns and relationships in data, and use these patterns to make decisions and predictions. For example, a machine learning algorithm could be trained to recognize images of cats, and then given a new image it would be able to identify whether or not it contains a cat.
