Lidar (`Light Detection and Ranging`) is a remote sensing technology that measures the distance to an object by emitting a laser light and then measuring the amount of time it takes for the light to return after bouncing off the object.

Lidar uses a sensor to measure the time of flight (TOF) of the laser pulses and then calculates the distance to the object that it has bounced off of. Lidar can be used to measure distances to objects in the air, on land, and underwater. It's most commonly used for mapping and navigation, but can also be used for 3D imaging and object detection.
