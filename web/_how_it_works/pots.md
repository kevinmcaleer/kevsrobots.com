`Pots` (`Potentiometers`) are electrical components that are used to **measure** and **adjust** the amount of resistance in a circuit.

They have three terminals and are commonly used as volume controls and in adjustable circuits. The resistance of the potentiometer is adjusted by rotating a shaft or sliding a contact along a track.

## Types of Pots

There are two main types of potentiometers: rotary and linear.

Rotary potentiometers have a circular track that is rotated by the shaft, while linear potentiometers have a straight track that is adjusted by sliding the contact. 

Both types can be used to measure the position of the contact along the track, or to control the amount of resistance in the circuit.

## Logarithmic vs Linear pots

`Logarithmic` pots are used for audio applications because they provide a more natural response when turning the pot.

`Linear` pots, on the other hand, provide a consistent output across the entire range of the pot. Logarithmic pots are better suited for applications where the user needs to make more subtle adjustments over a wider range, such as guitar volume and tone controls. Linear pots are better for applications where the user needs to make more precise adjustments over a smaller range, such as mixer faders.
