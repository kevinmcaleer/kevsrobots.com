`Clusters` are powerful tools in the computing world, designed to increase availability, reliability, and scalability of services. They are essentially groups of interconnected computers that work together as a single system to provide higher levels of computing power and reliability.

This guide will introduce you to the basics of clusters and how they function within various computing environments.

## How Do Clusters Work?

A [cluster](/resources/glossary#cluster) consists of multiple connected computers (often referred to as nodes) that work together to perform a set of tasks. These nodes communicate with each other through a high-speed network to ensure that operations are coordinated. When a task is initiated, the cluster's management software determines which node is best suited to perform the task, considering factors like current workload and node availability.

## What Are Clusters Made Of?

Clusters are composed of hardware and software components:

- **Hardware:** This includes the physical servers (nodes), networking equipment (like switches and routers), and storage devices that are interconnected.
  
- **Software:** Cluster management software is crucial for coordinating tasks among nodes, handling failover processes, and distributing the workload evenly. This software layer is what makes the collective resources of the cluster available to applications as if from a single source.

## Different Types of Clusters

Clusters can be categorized based on their primary purpose:

- **High-Availability (HA) Clusters:** Designed to ensure continuous operation by automatically failing over to standby nodes in case of a failure.
  
- **Load-Balancing Clusters:** Distribute incoming network traffic or application requests across multiple nodes to improve responsiveness and availability.
  
- **Computational/High-Performance Clusters:** Focus on providing significant computational power by combining the processing power of each node to execute complex calculations or process large datasets.
  
- **Storage Clusters:** Provide reliable and scalable storage solutions, distributing data across multiple nodes to improve access speed and redundancy.

## Who Invented Clusters?

The concept of clustering computers to form a more powerful and reliable system has evolved over decades. The history of clusters dates back to the 1960s and 1970s with the development of early distributed systems. However, the modern concept of computer clusters, as we know them today, began to take shape in the 1980s and 1990s with projects like the Beowulf Project, which aimed at creating high-performance but low-cost clusters using commodity hardware.

## Common Uses of Clusters

Clusters are used across various domains to enhance performance and reliability:

- **Web Services:** Clusters can distribute web traffic among servers, improving the speed and reliability of websites and web applications.
  
- **Databases:** Clustering database servers can provide high availability and load balancing, ensuring that database services remain accessible even in the event of hardware failure.
  
- **Scientific Computing:** High-performance clusters are used for complex simulations and calculations in fields like physics, chemistry, and bioinformatics.
  
- **Cloud Computing:** Cloud services rely on clusters to offer scalable and reliable computing resources to users on demand.

## Clustered-Pi

If you're interested in building your own cluster, check out our [Clustered-Pi](https://www.github.com/kevinmcaleer/ClusteredPi) project, which demonstrates how to create a Docker Swarm cluster using Raspberry Pi computers.

There is also a free course available for learning about [Docker](/learn/docker/), which is a key component in building and managing clusters.

## Conclusion

Clusters play a crucial role in modern computing by ensuring that systems are scalable, reliable, and available. Whether it's for running a high-traffic website, performing complex scientific calculations, or storing vast amounts of data, clusters offer a solution that single computers cannot. Understanding how clusters work and their applications is essential for anyone looking to delve into advanced computing concepts or improve the resilience and performance of their services.
