`Inverse kinematics` is a technique used in robotics and computer animation to calculate the joint angles needed to achieve a desired end position.

It is the opposite of forward kinematics, which calculates the position of the end point from the joint angles.

To solve an inverse kinematics problem, you need to start with the desired end point and work your way backwards to the starting joint angles. This can be done by using basic trigonometry, solving equations, or utilizing numerical methods. Once the joint angles are found, the robot or character can move to the desired end point.
