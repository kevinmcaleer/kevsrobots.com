A `battery` is a device that stores electrical energy in the form of chemical energy and converts it back into electrical energy when needed.

> ## What is it?
>
> Essentially, a battery is an electrochemical cell (or a combination of multiple cells) that generates an electric current through a chemical reaction between two electrodes (typically a positive and a negative electrode) and an electrolyte.| ![Battery](/assets/img/how_it_works/batteries08.png){:class="img-fluid w-50"}

Batteries come in various shapes, sizes, and capacities, and they can be classified as either primary or secondary batteries. `Primary batteries`, also known as disposable batteries, are single-use and cannot be recharged. They generate electricity as long as the chemical reactants are available. Common examples include `alkaline` batteries and `zinc-carbon` batteries.

`Secondary batteries`, also known as rechargeable batteries, can be recharged and reused multiple times. In these batteries, the chemical reactions that occur during discharge are reversible, allowing them to regain their stored energy when recharged. Common types of rechargeable batteries include `lithium-ion`, `nickel-cadmium`, and `nickel-metal-hydride` batteries.

## A Brief History of Batteries

The concept of batteries dates back over 2,000 years to the discovery of the Baghdad Battery, a clay jar believed to have been used to store electrical energy. However, the first true battery was invented in 1800 by Alessandro Volta, who created the "Voltaic Pile" by stacking alternating layers of zinc and copper disks separated by cardboard soaked in saltwater. This invention laid the groundwork for future developments in battery technology.

## Types of Batteries

There are numerous types of batteries available today, with the most common being:

1. `Alkaline Batteries` - Affordable and commonly found in household items like remote controls and toys, these batteries have a limited lifespan and are not rechargeable.
1. `Lead-Acid Batteries` - Used primarily in automotive applications, these batteries are known for their durability and high power output. They are, however, heavy and contain toxic materials.
1. `Lithium-Ion Batteries` - Widely used in consumer electronics and electric vehicles, lithium-ion batteries are lightweight, rechargeable, and have a high energy density. They do, however, suffer from aging and capacity loss over time.
1. `Nickel-Metal Hydride (NiMH) Batteries` - A popular choice for rechargeable batteries in consumer electronics, NiMH batteries offer improved capacity and performance compared to their predecessors, Nickel-Cadmium (NiCd) batteries.
1. `Solid-State Batteries` - An emerging technology, solid-state batteries replace the liquid electrolyte found in traditional batteries with a solid material, offering improved safety, higher energy density, and longer lifespans.

## Whats inside a battery?

Opening batteries is dangerous as the chemcials inside can react with the oxygen in the air and burst into flames, so don't try this at home.

## The Future of Battery Technology

As our reliance on batteries continues to grow, researchers and engineers are constantly seeking ways to improve their performance, safety, and sustainability. Some of the most promising developments in battery technology include:

1. **Silicon Anodes** - Replacing the traditional graphite anode with silicon can significantly increase a battery's energy density, allowing for longer runtimes and more compact designs.
1. **Lithium-Sulfur Batteries** - Offering a higher energy density than lithium-ion batteries, lithium-sulfur batteries have the potential to revolutionize the electric vehicle industry by providing longer driving ranges and reduced charging times.
1. **Battery Recycling** - With the rapid growth in electric vehicle adoption, developing efficient and cost-effective recycling processes for batteries has become a top priority. Innovations in battery recycling could help reduce the environmental impact of battery production and disposal while ensuring a sustainable supply of raw materials.
1. **Wireless Charging** - The development of wireless charging technologies could simplify the charging process for devices and electric vehicles, reducing the need for physical connectors and cables.
