`Diodes` are electrical components that allow current to flow through them in one direction.

They are made up of two terminals, an [anode](/resources/glossary#anode) and a [cathode](/resources/glossary#cathode), and a semiconductor material in between. The semiconductor material is usually made up of two types of doped silicon. When a voltage is applied to the anode, the electrons in the semiconductor material move to the anode, creating an area of low potential, or a depletion region, between the anode and the cathode.

This depletion region stops current from flowing from the cathode to the anode and allows current to only flow from the anode to the cathode. This allows the diode to act as a one-way valve for electrical current.

## Anode & Cathode

This diagram shows the Diode with its two terminals; anode and cathode. The diode usually has a stripe to indicate which end is the Cathode (-) terminal.

`Light emmiting diodes` (LEDs) are a special type of diode that produces light when current passes through it. The colour of the LED is defined by colour of the plastic that encases the compoent.
