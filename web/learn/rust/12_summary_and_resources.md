## Summary of What You've Learned

- **Introduction to Rust**: You learned why Rust is a powerful language, particularly for systems programming and scenarios requiring memory safety and concurrency.
- **Rust vs. Python**: We explored the differences between Rust and Python, helping those with Python experience transition to Rust.
- **Rust Basics**: Covered variables, data types, and control flow in Rust.
- **Ownership and Borrowing**: Introduced Rust's unique ownership system, along with concepts of borrowing and lifetimes.
- **Structs and Enums**: Discussed how to use structs and enums in Rust to organize and manage data.
- **Error Handling**: Examined Rust's approach to error handling using `Result` and `Option`.
- **Common Collections**: Went over Rust's data structures like vectors, strings, and hash maps.
- **Concurrency**: Learned about Rust's features for writing safe and efficient concurrent code.
- **Rust Ecosystem and Tools**: Explored Rust's tooling and community resources.
- **Building a Simple Web Application**: Applied your Rust knowledge to build a web application.
- **Rust for Raspberry Pi Pico**: Demonstrated how to set up Rust for embedded development on the Raspberry Pi Pico.
