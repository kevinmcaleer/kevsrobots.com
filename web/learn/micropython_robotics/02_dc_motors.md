DC motors are the core of many robotics projects ‚Äî they provide movement for wheels, arms, and even propellers. In this lesson, you'll learn how to control them using your Raspberry Pi Pico and a motor driver.

## üß† How It Works

The Raspberry Pi Pico can't drive a motor directly ‚Äî it doesn't output enough current. Instead, we use an **L298N H-bridge motor driver**, which allows the Pico to control the motor‚Äôs speed and direction using:

- **IN1 and IN2**: Control direction
- **ENA**: Controls speed via PWM
- **VCC**: Connects to motor power supply
- **GND**: Common ground
- **5V**: Optional logic power (can be left unused if powering Pico separately)

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Wiring the Circuit

Here‚Äôs how to connect a single motor to the L298N and Pico:

- Pico GP0 ‚Üí IN1  
- Pico GP1 ‚Üí IN2  
- Pico GP2 ‚Üí ENA (PWM control)  
- Motor ‚Üí Out1 and Out2  
- Battery pack + ‚Üí L298N VCC  
- Battery pack ‚Äì ‚Üí L298N GND  
- Pico GND ‚Üí L298N GND  

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do **not** connect motor power (VCC) directly to the Pico!

## üß™ Writing the Code

Here's a simple MicroPython script to control motor direction and speed:

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM
from time import sleep

# Motor control pins
in1 = Pin(0, Pin.OUT)
in2 = Pin(1, Pin.OUT)
ena = PWM(Pin(2))
ena.freq(1000)

def motor_forward(speed=65025):
    in1.high()
    in2.low()
    ena.duty_u16(speed)

def motor_backward(speed=65025):
    in1.low()
    in2.high()
    ena.duty_u16(speed)

def motor_stop():
    in1.low()
    in2.low()
    ena.duty_u16(0)

# Test
motor_forward()
sleep(2)
motor_backward()
sleep(2)
motor_stop()
```

You can adjust the speed by changing the speed parameter (range: 0‚Äì65535).

## üß© Try It Yourself

* Reverse the motor direction.
* Slow the motor down by reducing PWM.
* Try turning the motor on/off with a button or switch.

Now that you can control a motor, you're one step closer to making your robot move!
