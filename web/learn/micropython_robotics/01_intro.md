Robots donâ€™t have to be complicated â€” and with **MicroPython and the Raspberry Pi Pico**, you can build intelligent, moving robots using just a few components and a bit of code.

In this course, weâ€™ll go beyond blinking LEDs and dive into the world of **motor control**, **sensor feedback**, and **robotic behavior**, all powered by Python.

---

## ðŸ¤– What Youâ€™ll Learn

In this course, youâ€™ll build your own simple, programmable robot and learn how to:

- Control DC motors using motor drivers
- Follow lines using IR sensors
- Avoid obstacles using ultrasonic sensors
- Use servos to scan the environment
- Build a two-wheeled robot chassis
- Add remote control with Bluetooth or Wi-Fi
- Write basic autonomous behaviors

---

## ðŸ”§ What Youâ€™ll Need

To get the most out of this course, we recommend having:

- Raspberry Pi Pico or Pico W (for Wi-Fi control)
- L298N motor driver module
- 2x DC gear motors and wheels
- 1x ultrasonic sensor (e.g. HC-SR04)
- 1x IR line-following sensor or sensor array
- 1x servo motor (e.g. SG90)
- Battery holder or power supply
- Jumper wires and breadboard or soldered connections
- Optional: HC-05 Bluetooth module (for Bluetooth control)

If youâ€™re using the **Pico W**, youâ€™ll also need a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network for wireless control.

---

## ðŸ§  Why Learn Robotics with MicroPython?

Learning robotics with MicroPython is a great way to:

- Combine coding with physical computing
- Explore automation and control systems
- Develop skills for more complex projects like autonomous rovers or IoT devices
- Build fun, hands-on projects that reinforce programming concepts

Youâ€™ll also get experience with real-world hardware components like sensors and motor drivers.

---

By the end of this course, youâ€™ll have built your own functioning robot and programmed it to move, sense, and react to its environment.

Letâ€™s get started!
