Congratulations ‚Äî you‚Äôve completed the **MicroPython Robotics Projects with the Raspberry Pi Pico** course!

You‚Äôve gone from individual components to a functioning robot that can sense, move, react, and even be controlled wirelessly. That‚Äôs a huge achievement in the world of physical computing!

---

## ‚úÖ What You‚Äôve Learned

By completing this course, you‚Äôve gained experience with:

- Controlling DC motors using H-bridge drivers
- Reading input from IR and ultrasonic sensors
- Programming autonomous and reactive behaviors
- Mounting and wiring a two-wheeled robot chassis
- Using a servo to scan the environment
- Adding remote control via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
- Building and testing a complete robotics project

---

## üöÄ What‚Äôs Next?

Here are some ways you can take your skills further:

### üîß Build Smarter Robots
- Add encoders to track distance and speed
- Explore PID control for smoother motion
- Experiment with multiple sensor types (light, temperature, compass, etc.)

### üß† Add Logic and AI
- Use conditionals to make more complex decisions
- Try micropython libraries for machine learning at the edge
- Implement basic mapping or obstacle memory

### üï∏Ô∏è Connect to the Cloud
- Send sensor data to a web dashboard
- Control your robot over the internet
- Log your robot‚Äôs movements for analysis

### ü§ñ Explore Other Microcontrollers
- Try MicroPython on ESP32 or other boards
- Compare features and performance
- Use additional hardware like cameras or GPS modules

---

## üß© Share What You‚Äôve Built

We‚Äôd love to see your final robot! Share your photos, code, and write-ups on your favorite maker forums or tag us on social media.
