An **H-bridge** is a circuit that lets you control the direction of a DC motor by switching the current flow. It‚Äôs essential for robotics because it allows you to drive motors forward and backward with just a few control signals.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the H-Bridge Works

The H-bridge gets its name from the circuit diagram, which looks like an ‚ÄúH‚Äù made of transistors or switches.

{% include gallery.html titles="H Bridge" images="assets/hbridge.jpg" descriptions="The S1 - S4 in this diagram are Transistors that act like switches. The motors are controlled by these switches." noborder=true cols=2 %}

---

It allows current to flow in either direction through the motor:

- IN1 high, IN2 low ‚Üí forward
- IN1 low, IN2 high ‚Üí backward
- IN1 and IN2 same ‚Üí brake/stop

When paired with **PWM on the enable pin**, you can also control the **speed** of the motor.

## üîå Wiring Two Motors with L298N

{% include gallery.html titles="L298N Motor Driver" images="assets/l298n.png" descriptions="Works with up to 12v for powerful motors." cols=2 %}

---

The L298N has two H-bridges inside ‚Äî perfect for controlling two motors independently. Here‚Äôs a typical wiring setup:

- **Motor A**
  - GP0 ‚Üí IN1  
  - GP1 ‚Üí IN2  
  - GP2 (PWM) ‚Üí ENA  

- **Motor B**
  - GP3 ‚Üí IN3  
  - GP4 ‚Üí IN4  
  - GP5 (PWM) ‚Üí ENB  

`GP` pins are the GPIO pins on the Pico.

{% include gallery.html images="assets/pico_pinouts.jpg" titles="Raspberry Pi Pico Pinouts" descriptions="Each of the green edge connectors are referred to as GPIO or General Purpose Input Output pins. The black are the common ground pins." cols=2 %}

---

> Don't forget: Pico GND must connect to L298N GND.

---

## üß™ Writing the Code

Here‚Äôs a MicroPython script for controlling both motors:

```python
from machine import Pin, PWM
from time import sleep

# Motor A
in1 = Pin(0, Pin.OUT)
in2 = Pin(1, Pin.OUT)
ena = PWM(Pin(2))
ena.freq(1000)

# Motor B
in3 = Pin(3, Pin.OUT)
in4 = Pin(4, Pin.OUT)
enb = PWM(Pin(5))
enb.freq(1000)

def motor_a_forward(speed=50000):
    in1.high()
    in2.low()
    ena.duty_u16(speed)

def motor_a_backward(speed=50000):
    in1.low()
    in2.high()
    ena.duty_u16(speed)

def motor_b_forward(speed=50000):
    in3.high()
    in4.low()
    enb.duty_u16(speed)

def motor_b_backward(speed=50000):
    in3.low()
    in4.high()
    enb.duty_u16(speed)

def stop_motors():
    in1.low()
    in2.low()
    in3.low()
    in4.low()
    ena.duty_u16(0)
    enb.duty_u16(0)

# Test
motor_a_forward()
motor_b_forward()
sleep(2)

motor_a_backward()
motor_b_backward()
sleep(2)

stop_motors()
```

## ü§ñ Why This Matters

With two motors under your control, you can:

- Drive forward/backward

- Turn left/right

- Rotate on the spot (tank steering)

This forms the basic movement logic for most two-wheeled robots.

---

## üß© Try It Yourself

Try setting different speeds for left and right motors.

- Create a function to ‚Äúspin in place.‚Äù

- Add buttons to manually control each motor.

You‚Äôre now ready to add some intelligence to your robot!
