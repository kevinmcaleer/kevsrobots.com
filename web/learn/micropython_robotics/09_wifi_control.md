Bluetooth is great, but with the **Pico W**, you can control your robot over **Wi-Fi** ‚Äî even from a browser on your phone or computer. In this lesson, we‚Äôll host a simple web interface that sends commands to your robot in real time.

---

## üì° What You‚Äôll Need

- Raspberry Pi Pico W (instead of the standard Pico)
- A 2.4GHz Wi-Fi network
- Smartphone or computer with a modern browser

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This lesson requires the `rp2-pico-w` MicroPython firmware (with networking support).

---

## üîå Basic Setup

Update your Pico W with the latest MicroPython firmware, then connect it to Wi-Fi:

```python
import network
import time

ssid = 'YOUR_SSID'
password = 'YOUR_PASSWORD'

wlan = network.WLAN(network.STA_IF)
wlan.active(True)
wlan.connect(ssid, password)

while not wlan.isconnected():
    time.sleep(1)

print('Connected, IP:', wlan.ifconfig()[0])
```

---

## üåê Serve a Web Page for Control

This example creates a web server that lets you send movement commands by clicking buttons:

```python
import socket

html = """<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head><title>Robot Control</title></head>
<body>
<h2>Robot Control Panel</h2>
<form>
<button name="cmd" value="f">Forward</button>
<button name="cmd" value="b">Backward</button><br><br>
<button name="cmd" value="l">Left</button>
<button name="cmd" value="r">Right</button><br><br>
<button name="cmd" value="s">Stop</button>
</form>
</body>
</html>
"""

addr = socket.getaddrinfo('0.0.0.0', 80)[0][-1]

s = socket.socket()
s.bind(addr)
s.listen(1)

print("Listening on", addr)

while True:
    cl, addr = s.accept()
    print("Client connected:", addr)
    request = cl.recv(1024).decode()
    print("Request:", request)

    if '/?cmd=f' in request:
        forward()
    elif '/?cmd=b' in request:
        backward()
    elif '/?cmd=l' in request:
        left()
    elif '/?cmd=r' in request:
        right()
    elif '/?cmd=s' in request:
        stop()

    cl.send('HTTP/1.0 200 OK\r\nContent-type: text/html\r\n\r\n')
    cl.send(html)
    cl.close()
```

Make sure to define forward(), backward(), etc., from earlier lessons.

## üß™ Test It Out

- Connect the Pico W to Wi-Fi
- Open the IP address shown in the REPL on your phone‚Äôs browser
- Use the buttons to control your robot!

---

## üß© Try It Yourself

- Add more buttons (e.g., for speed control)
- Style the interface with CSS
- Use AJAX for real-time control without reloading

---

Now your robot has a wireless dashboard, ready to drive from across the room!
