This course is divided into the following lessons:

1. Introduction to MicroPython
2. GPIO Pins and Pin Numbering
3. Digital I/O and PWM
4. Analog Inputs and ADC
5. I2C and SPI
6. Ultrasonic Range Finders
7. Using Servos
8. Using Motors
9. Using Potentiometers
10. Using Temperature Sensors
11. Recap and Review

## Key Results

After completing this course, you will be able to:

* Understand the basics of MicroPython and how to use it to control the Raspberry Pi Pico
* Connect different components to the board and control them with MicroPython code
* Identify different types of GPIO pins and their functions

## How the course works

Each lesson in this course is designed to be self-contained and can be completed in any order. The lessons start with an overview of the topic and then dive into the details with examples of real code.

New keywords are introduced and explained, and are highlighted to help emphasize them.

For example, keywords are highlighted inline with the lesson text like `this`.

Important notes will be highlighted in sections like the two below:

> ## This is a note
