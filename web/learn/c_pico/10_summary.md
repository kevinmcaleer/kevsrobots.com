üéâ Congratulations ‚Äî you‚Äôve completed your first C programming course on the Raspberry Pi Pico!

You‚Äôve gone from absolute beginner to writing real C programs that interact with **hardware**. That‚Äôs a huge leap ‚Äî well done!

---

## What You‚Äôve Learned

Here‚Äôs a quick review of your new skills:

- The basics of the **C programming language**
- Variables, conditionals, loops, and functions
- How to install the **Pico SDK** and compile C code
- How to upload `.uf2` files to the Raspberry Pi Pico
- How to use **GPIO pins** to control real-world hardware
- How to build a simple **blinking LED circuit**

---

## What You‚Äôve Built

You created a complete hardware/software project:

- C code that runs on a microcontroller
- A functioning circuit with an LED
- A reliable workflow for development and flashing

---

## Where to Go Next

You‚Äôve got a strong foundation ‚Äî now it‚Äôs time to go further:

### Learn More C

- Use structs, arrays, and pointers
- Work with interrupts and timers
- Write reusable header files and libraries

---

### Build More Projects

- Add buttons and read inputs
- Control a buzzer or servo motor
- Interface with sensors (temperature, motion, etc.)

---

### Explore Online Resources

- [Raspberry Pi Pico SDK Docs](https://raspberrypi.github.io/pico-sdk-doxygen/)
- [Embedded C Tutorials on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=embedded+c+raspberry+pi+pico)
- [Pico Project Examples on GitHub](https://github.com/raspberrypi/pico-examples)

---

## Final Thoughts

You‚Äôve started your journey into the world of **embedded systems**, **low-level programming**, and **physical computing**. The C language and the Raspberry Pi Pico are powerful tools ‚Äî and now you know how to use them.

Keep building, keep learning, and share what you create. üöÄ
