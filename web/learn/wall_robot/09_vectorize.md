## Vectorizing Images

1. **Install Inkscape**:
   - Inkscape is a powerful tool for creating vector graphics. Install it using:
     ```sh
     sudo apt-get install inkscape
     ```

2. **Convert an Image to SVG**:
   - Open your image in Inkscape.
   - Use the "Trace Bitmap" feature to convert the image to a vector format.
   - Save the vectorized image as an SVG file.

3. **Parse SVG File in Python**:
   - Use a library like `svgpathtools` to parse and convert SVG paths into motor commands.

4. **Update the Control Code**:
   - Modify your control code to read SVG paths and translate them into motor movements.
