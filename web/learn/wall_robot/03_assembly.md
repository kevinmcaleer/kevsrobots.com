## Assembly

1. **Mount the Stepper Motors**: Secure the stepper motors at the top corners of your drawing area (e.g., a whiteboard or a large sheet of paper on a wall).
2. **Attach the Pulley String**: Connect the toothed pulley string to both stepper motors, ensuring it runs smoothly.
3. **Prepare the Gondola**: Attach the marker pen to the gondola and secure the micro servo motor to the gondola. The servo will lift and lower the pen.
4. **Connect the Gondola**: Suspend the gondola between the two motors using the pulley string. Ensure it can move freely up and down.

Your robot assembly is complete. Now, let's move on to wiring the components.
