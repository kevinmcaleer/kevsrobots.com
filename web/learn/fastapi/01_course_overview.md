## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. It's designed to create APIs that are intuitive to write and easy to read and test.

---

## Understanding User Authentication

User authentication is a process that verifies the identity of a user attempting to access a system. It's crucial for securing sensitive information and ensuring that only authorized users can perform certain actions.

---

## Why Use FastAPI for Authentication?

- **Speed and Performance:** FastAPI is one of the fastest web frameworks for Python, ideal for handling authentication requests efficiently.
- **Ease of Use:** With straightforward syntax and built-in support for data validation and serialization, FastAPI simplifies the development of secure APIs.
- **Asynchronous Support:** FastAPI supports asynchronous request handling, making it suitable for high-concurrency environments.

---

## Real-World Application

By integrating FastAPI with a statically generated site like Jekyll, you can add dynamic features such as user authentication, combining the security and speed of static sites with the flexibility of dynamic content.

---

## Getting Ready

Next, we'll dive into setting up our development environment and starting our project with FastAPI, laying the groundwork for adding authentication features to your Jekyll site.
