### 1 Print the Parts

Download the build files from thingiverse. [Click here for the latest version:](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2662828)

There are a couple of basic parts to build your SMARS:

### 3D Printed Parts

It makes sense to print the parts in roughtly the order you are going to construct it in:

1. [The chassis](/assets/stl/smars/chassis.stl)
1. [The powered wheels x2](/assets/stl/smars/powered_wheel.stl)
1. [The unpowered wheels x2](/assets/stl/smars/unpowered_wheel.stl)
1. [The mechanical tracks x32](/assets/stl/smars/tracks.stl)
1. [The holding board (for the 9v battery)](/assets/stl/smars/motor_holder.stl)
1. [The range finder holder](/assets/stl/smars/range_finder_holder.stl)
1. [The range finder cover](/assets/stl/smars/range_finder_cover.stl)

Item                    | Description            | Qty | Price
------------------------|------------------------|:---:|-----:
Ultrasonic Range finder | SR HC-04 Range Finder  |  1  | £2.50
Arduino                 | Arduino Uno V3         |  1  | £14.99
Motor Shield            | Fundumoto motor shield |  1  | £15.00
Motors                  | 6v N20 150RPM motors   |  2  | £6.99

You will also need:

- some wire (preferably black and red)
- some solder
- some flux to make the solder adhere properly.

### Tools

Tools required are:

- a 3d printer
- filament
- a soldering iron

### 3D Printer settings

- The printer can be comfortably set to 50% infill
- Use different coloured filament to give your SMARS some style
