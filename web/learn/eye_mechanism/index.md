## Overview

This course will teach you how to model an eye mechanism using Autodesk Fusion 360. The eye mechanism has two eyelids that open and close around a central part using just one servo. You can 3d print the resulting parts and include them in your own robot.

---

## What you'll learn

In this course you will learn how to:

* Model a full eye mechanism in Fusion 360
* use the revolve function to create complex parts
* use offset planes
* construct mid-planes
* project a sketch onto a curved surface
* make two parts revolve around a point with the joint function
* animate in Fusion 360
* export each part so it can be 3d printed

---

### What you'll need

* Autodesk Fusion 360 [^1] installed on your computer

[^1]: In this course you will be using the features of Autodesk Fusion 360; there is a free educational and hobbyist licence available enabling you to use the software free of charge.
