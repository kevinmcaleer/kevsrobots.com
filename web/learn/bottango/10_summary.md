Congratulations â€” youâ€™ve completed the **Bottango Basics** course! ðŸŽ‰

Youâ€™ve learned how to install Bottango, connect and configure servos, design animations, add interactivity, and even run projects without a computer.

---

## âœ… What Youâ€™ve Learned

Over this course, youâ€™ve covered:

- âœ… Installing and launching Bottango on your computer  
- âœ… Setting up supported boards like Arduino Uno or ESP32  
- âœ… Safely wiring and powering servos  
- âœ… Creating motion sequences with keyframes and easing  
- âœ… Triggering animations with keyboard, gamepad, or GPIO  
- âœ… Syncing motion to music and sound  
- âœ… Exporting for standalone Arduino Mode  
- âœ… Controlling servos in real time with a gamepad  

Thatâ€™s a solid foundation for any animatronic, robotics, or interactive art project!

## ðŸ’¡ Project Ideas

Now that you know how to use Bottango, here are a few ideas to spark your creativity:

- ðŸ¤– A talking robot head that lip-syncs to voice or sound
- ðŸŽƒ A Halloween prop that jumps when triggered by motion
- ðŸ¦¾ A mechanical hand or puppet controlled by joystick
- ðŸŽ­ An animatronic face for cosplay or theater performances
- ðŸŽ¼ A servo-powered drum machine that plays along with music
