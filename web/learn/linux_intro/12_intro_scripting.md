## Introduction

Shell scripting allows you to automate tasks on your Raspberry Pi by writing scriptsâ€”collections of commands executed in sequence. This lesson introduces you to the basics of shell scripting, including how to create and run simple scripts.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what a shell script is and its uses.
- Create a simple shell script.
- Run and test your shell script.

---

### What is a Shell Script?

A `shell script` is a text file containing a sequence of commands that the shell (command interpreter) can execute. Shell scripts can automate repetitive tasks, manage system configurations, and much more.

---

### Creating a Simple Shell Script

`echo` is a command that prints text to the terminal.

      echo "Hello, World!"

This will simply print "Hello, World!" to the terminal.

You can also redirect the text to a file by using the `>` operator:

      echo "Hello, World!" > hello.sh

This will create a file named `hello.sh` that contains the text "Hello, World!".

How do we know the contents of the file? For that, we can use the `cat` command.

---

## What is the `cat` Command?

`cat` (catalog) is a command that displays the contents of a file:

   cat hello.sh

---

## How to Edit a File

`echo` and `cat` only works if you want to add a single line of text, or show the contents of a file. If you want to add multiple lines of text or edit an existing file you can use a text editor like `nano`.

---

To create a shell script, you can use the `nano` text editor. For example, to create a script that prints "Hello, World!":

1. Open `nano` and create a new file:

         nano hello.sh

   Add the following content to the file:

         #!/bin/bash
         echo "Hello, World!"

   Save and exit nano (use `Ctrl + O` to save and `Ctrl + X` to exit).

---

## Running Your Shell Script

To run your script, you need to make it executable and then execute it:

Make the script executable:

      chmod +x hello.sh

   This will give the script permission to run as an executable.

   Run the script:

      ./hello.sh

You should see "Hello, World!" printed in the terminal.

---

## Vim

If you prefer using `vim` as a text editor, you can create a shell script using the following steps:

1. Open `vim` and create a new file:

         vim hello.sh

1. Press `i` to enter insert mode and add the following content to the file:

         #!/bin/bash
         echo "Hello, World!"

1. Press `Esc` to exit insert mode, then type `:wq` and press `Enter` to save and exit.

> ## What does Vim stand for
>
> Vim stands for Vi IMproved.
>
> ---
>
> ### Explanation
>
> `Vi`: Vim is an enhanced version of the older text editor called `vi`, which stands for "visual." Vi was one of the earliest text editors in the Unix operating system and became widely used due to its efficiency and powerful editing capabilities.
>
`IMproved`: Vim stands for "Vi IMproved" because it includes many enhancements and additional features that were not present in the original vi editor. These improvements include features like syntax highlighting, multi-level undo, support for plugins, and a more extensive command set, making it a much more powerful and flexible tool than the original vi.
>
> `vim` retains compatibility with `vi` while offering these additional features, which is why it's often considered a superset of `vi`. Despite its steep learning curve, Vim is highly regarded for its speed, efficiency, and the extensive control it gives users over text editing.

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned what a shell script is and how to create and run a simple shell script. Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks and managing your Raspberry Pi more efficiently.
