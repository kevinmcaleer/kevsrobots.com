In the previous lesson, we compared electricity to a river, flowing and doing work as a result of certain forces. Now, let's meet the 'rocks', 'turbines', and 'dams' that manipulate this river in useful ways. These are the components that make up every electronic device.

## Resistors

A resistor is like a narrow part of our river - it resists the flow of electricity, or current, through a circuit. By adjusting the level of resistance, we can control how much current flows through a particular part of the circuit. Resistors are vital in protecting components from receiving too much current, which can damage them.

## Capacitors

If a resistor is a narrowing of the river, then a capacitor is a reservoir. Capacitors store energy in an electric field for later use. They can collect charge over time and then release it all at once, like a dam opening its gates. This makes capacitors useful in many applications, such as smoothing out irregularities in power supply or powering a camera flash.

## Inductors

Inductors are similar to capacitors in that they also store energy, but they store it in a magnetic field instead of an electric field. This is like a turbine in our river, which accumulates energy from the moving water. Inductors are used in many applications, from filtering signals to storing energy in power supplies.

## Semiconductors

Semiconductors are the real magicians of our electronic world. They can act like resistors, capacitors, and switches, depending on how we use them. They are like the various machines and tools that manipulate the water's flow for specific purposes. Semiconductors form the basis of diodes, transistors, and integrated circuits, which are the building blocks of all modern electronics.

Understanding these fundamental components is key to learning electronics. They form the building blocks of all electronic circuits, and combining them in various ways allows us to create everything from a simple light switch to a supercomputer. So let's explore each of these components in more detail in the following lessons.
