* [Redis basics](02_redis_basics#redis-basics)
* [Strings and key-value pairs](03_data_types#string-data-type)
* [Lists](05_redis_lists#adding-and-retrieving-list-elements)
* [Sets](06_redis_sets#adding-and-retrieving-set-elements)
* [Hashes](07_redis_hashes#adding-and-retrieving-hash-elements)
* [Sorted sets](08_redis_sorted_sets#adding-and-retrieving-sorted-set-elements)

### Review

Redis is a powerful and versatile in-memory data store that can be used for a wide range of applications, from caching and session storage to message queuing and real-time analytics. In this course, we covered the basics of Redis and how to use it with Python.

We started with simple key-value pairs and strings, and then moved on to more advanced data types like lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets. We also covered pub/sub messaging and how to use Redis with Python.

By the end of this course, you should have a solid understanding of the basics of Redis and how to use it with Python. You should be able to use Redis to solve a wide range of data storage and messaging problems in your own applications.

### Conclusion

In this course, we covered Redis and how to use it with Python. We covered a range of topics, from simple key-value pairs to more advanced data types like lists, sets, hashes, and sorted sets, as well as pub/sub messaging. By the end of this course, you should have a solid understanding of Redis and how to use it with Python.

Thank you for taking this course, and we hope you found it useful and informative!
