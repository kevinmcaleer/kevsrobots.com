This guide covers the installation process and the basic requirements to get you started with face, hand, and posture detection.

## Using CVZone with Python on a Raspberry Pi: A Comprehensive Tutorial

In the ever-evolving field of computer vision, having the right tools is crucial. `CVZone`, a sought-after computer vision library, brings robust capabilities to developers. When combined with the flexibility of a Raspberry Pi, you can harness its power for various applications, including face, hand, and posture detection. This tutorial aims to guide you through setting up your Raspberry Pi environment to use CVZone efficiently.

## Requirements

- **Raspberry Pi:** Ensure it's running Raspbian OS.
- **Camera:** You can opt for the Raspberry Pi's native camera module or a compatible USB webcam.
- **Libraries:** CVZone and OpenCV are the mainstays for our computer vision tasks.
- **Python:** Version 3.6 or later is recommended for compatibility and performance.

## Installation Steps

1. **Setting up your Raspberry Pi:**
   - Begin with a Raspberry Pi with Raspbian OS already installed.
   - Connect your chosen camera module or USB webcam to the Raspberry Pi. Ensure that it's compatible and properly detected by the system.

2. **Install OpenCV:**

   OpenCV is a foundational library for computer vision. Install it using the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev python3-opencv
   ```

3. **Install CVZone:**

   With OpenCV in place, you can now proceed to install CVZone:

   ```bash
   pip3 install cvzone
   ```
