🎉 Congratulations! You've completed the **Running K3s on Raspberry Pi** course.

Over the past lessons, you’ve transformed a few Raspberry Pi boards into a full-featured **Kubernetes cluster** — one that’s capable of running real workloads, supporting modern deployment workflows, and mirroring production systems on a small scale.

---

## ✅ What You’ve Learned

Here’s a quick recap of what you’ve accomplished:

- 🧠 **Kubernetes Concepts**: Pods, services, deployments, ingress, RBAC, and more
- 🏗 **Cluster Setup**: Installed and configured a multi-node K3s cluster
- 🌐 **Networking**: Configured static IPs, hostnames, and ingress routing
- 💾 **Storage**: Used local-path storage and persistent volumes
- 🔄 **CI/CD**: Set up automated deployment with GitHub Actions or GitOps
- 🔐 **Security**: Applied RBAC, secrets, TLS, and best practices
- ⚙️ **Advanced Topics**: Swapped CNIs and secured the control plane

---

## 🧱 What You’ve Built

Your cluster can now:

- Run scalable containerized apps
- Support multi-service workloads with persistent data
- Use Ingress for clean routing and domain-based access
- Update and deploy applications automatically
- Serve as a testbed for real-world Kubernetes learning

---

## 🚀 Where to Go Next

Here are a few directions you can explore beyond this course:

### 🔹 Build Your Own Helm Charts

Package your apps for reusability across environments.

### 🔹 Set Up Multi-Cluster Environments

Use tools like K3s + K3s or connect to a public cloud via kubeconfig.

### 🔹 Explore Advanced GitOps

Use ArgoCD or Flux with Helm and automated sync from Git.

### 🔹 Learn About Service Meshes

Try Linkerd or Istio on ARM devices for microservice observability and traffic management.

### 🔹 Join the Kubernetes Community

Contribute to open source, join meetups, or get certified (CKA, CKAD).

---

## 🧠 Suggested Projects

- Self-hosted Git server or Gitea with CI/CD
- Kubernetes-powered homelab dashboard
- IoT fleet manager using MQTT + K3s
- Personal blog or portfolio deployed via GitHub Actions
