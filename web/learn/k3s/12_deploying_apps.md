Now that your K3s cluster is running and accessible via services and ingress, it's time to deploy a **real-world application**.

In this lesson, you'll deploy a simple web app with a backing Redis database using **Deployments**, **Services**, and an **Ingress** rule.

---

## üß© Example App: Python + Redis

We‚Äôll deploy:

- A Flask web app (`web`)
- A Redis database (`redis`)

These will be connected using environment variables and services.

---

## üìÅ Step 1: Create Deployment YAML

Create a file called `webapp.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web
        image: kevdev/web-redis-demo:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 5000
        env:
        - name: REDIS_HOST
          value: redis
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  selector:
    app: web
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 80
    targetPort: 5000
````

This assumes you have a Docker image like `kevdev/web-redis-demo` on Docker Hub ‚Äî update it with your own image if needed.

---

## üß± Step 2: Add Redis Deployment

Append this to the same file or create a separate `redis.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: redis
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: redis
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: redis
        image: redis:alpine
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: redis
spec:
  selector:
    app: redis
  ports:
  - protocol: TCP
    port: 6379
```

---

## üöÄ Step 3: Apply to the Cluster

```bash
kubectl apply -f webapp.yaml
kubectl apply -f redis.yaml
```

Verify everything is running:

```bash
kubectl get pods
kubectl get svc
```

---

## üåê Step 4: Add Ingress

Create a file called `webapp-ingress.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: web-ingress
  annotations:
    traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: web
spec:
  rules:
  - host: web.local
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: web
            port:
              number: 80
```

Apply it:

```bash
kubectl apply -f webapp-ingress.yaml
```

Add this to `/etc/hosts` on your local machine:

```text
192.168.1.100 web.local
```

Visit `http://web.local` in your browser!

---

## üß™ Optional: Scale Your App

```bash
kubectl scale deployment web --replicas=3
```

See the load balancing in action (especially with Ingress).

---

## ‚úÖ Summary

You now know how to:

- Deploy multi-container apps using YAML
- Connect services via internal DNS
- Expose apps using Ingress
- Scale deployments with one command
