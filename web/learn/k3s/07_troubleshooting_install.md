Even though K3s simplifies Kubernetes installation, things can still go wrong ‚Äî especially with Raspberry Pis.

This lesson walks you through **common issues** and how to troubleshoot them effectively.

---

## üß™ Problem: Node Doesn‚Äôt Join Cluster

### ‚ùå Symptom:

Worker node installs, but doesn't show up with `kubectl get nodes`.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

- Ensure you're using the correct master IP:

  ```bash
  ping <MASTER-IP>
  ```

- Verify port 6443 is open and not firewalled.
- Check the K3s agent logs on the worker:

  ```bash
  journalctl -u k3s-agent -e
  ```

---

## üîê Problem: Token Rejected

### ‚ùå Symptom:

Worker node fails to join with error about invalid token.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

- Re-check token syntax:

  ```bash
  sudo cat /var/lib/rancher/k3s/server/node-token
  ```

- Ensure no extra characters or missing colons.
- If needed, regenerate token by reinstalling K3s on master with:

  ```bash
  /usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
  ```

---

## üõë Problem: k3s.service or k3s-agent.service Won‚Äôt Start

### ‚ùå Symptom:

K3s or agent fails to start on boot.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

Check logs:

```bash
journalctl -u k3s -e
journalctl -u k3s-agent -e
```

Common fixes:

- Ensure `cgroup` support is enabled:
  Check `/boot/cmdline.txt` or `/boot/firmware/cmdline.txt` has:

  ```text
  cgroup_memory=1 cgroup_enable=memory cgroup_enable=cpuset
  ```

- Check for disk space:

  ```bash
  df -h
  ```

- Restart the service:

  ```bash
  sudo systemctl restart k3s
  ```

---

## üåê Problem: Hostname/IP Confusion

### ‚ùå Symptom:

Worker tries to join but fails due to DNS or unreachable host.

### ‚úÖ Solution:

- Always use the master‚Äôs **IP address**, not its hostname (unless you have proper DNS).
- Confirm static IPs are in place.
- Optionally set `/etc/hosts` on each node.

---

## üßπ Problem: You Want to Reinstall from Scratch

### ‚úÖ Solution:

**On master:**

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/k3s-uninstall.sh
```

**On worker:**

```bash
sudo /usr/local/bin/k3s-agent-uninstall.sh
```

Then reinstall as per earlier lessons.

## ‚úÖ General Troubleshooting Checklist

| Step                       | Command                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Check node status          | `kubectl get nodes`             |
| View K3s logs              | `journalctl -u k3s -e`          |
| View agent logs (worker)   | `journalctl -u k3s-agent -e`    |
| Check config               | `cat /etc/rancher/k3s/k3s.yaml` |
| Inspect cluster components | `kubectl get pods -A`           |

Once your cluster is running and stable, it‚Äôs time to start using it!
