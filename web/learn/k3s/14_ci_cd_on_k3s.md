Running apps manually is fine for testing, but to manage real applications, you need **CI/CD** â€” Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

In this lesson, youâ€™ll learn how to automate deployment to your K3s cluster using tools like **GitHub Actions**, **kubectl**, and **GitOps platforms** such as **ArgoCD** or **Flux**.

---

## ðŸ”„ CI/CD Overview

A typical CI/CD pipeline for K3s:

1. Push to GitHub repo
2. GitHub Actions builds container image
3. Push image to Docker Hub or GHCR
4. Deploy to K3s using:
   - `kubectl apply`
   - or GitOps controller (ArgoCD/Flux)

---

## ðŸ›  Option 1: GitHub Actions + kubectl

### ðŸ§± Step 1: Set Up Kubeconfig Access

To allow GitHub Actions to deploy, save your `~/.kube/config` from your master node, base64-encode it:

```bash
cat ~/.kube/config | base64 -w 0
````

Add it as a **GitHub Secret** (e.g., `KUBECONFIG_B64`).

---

### ðŸ“„ Step 2: Sample GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Deploy to K3s

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up kubectl
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.KUBECONFIG_B64 }}" | base64 -d > kubeconfig
          export KUBECONFIG=$PWD/kubeconfig
          kubectl version --client

      - name: Apply manifests
        run: |
          kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

Your repo should have a `k8s/` folder with Kubernetes manifests.

---

## ðŸš€ Option 2: GitOps with ArgoCD or Flux

GitOps tools automatically sync your cluster with a Git repository.

### ðŸ“¦ Benefits:

- Full version control of deployments
- Rollbacks via Git history
- Auto-syncing of environments

### ðŸ§° Getting Started with ArgoCD:

```bash
kubectl create namespace argocd
kubectl apply -n argocd \
  -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/argoproj/argo-cd/stable/manifests/install.yaml
```

Access ArgoCD UI:

```bash
kubectl port-forward svc/argocd-server -n argocd 8080:443
```

Default login:

- user: `admin`
- password: (from secret)

```bash
kubectl get secret argocd-initial-admin-secret -n argocd -o jsonpath="{.data.password}" | base64 -d
```

Connect your Git repo and ArgoCD will deploy automatically on changes.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Summary

You now know how to:

- Use GitHub Actions to deploy apps to K3s
- Securely handle kubeconfig in CI pipelines
- Use ArgoCD or Flux for GitOps-style automation
- Build production-ready workflows from your Raspberry Pi cluster
