## Linking Notes

Linking notes is one of the most powerful features in Obsidian. By connecting your notes, you create a web of knowledge that’s easy to navigate and expand.

---

## How to Link Notes

- Use double square brackets to link to another note: `[[Note Title]]`.
- As you type, Obsidian will suggest existing notes to link to, or you can create a new note by entering a new name.

---

**Example:**

```
Today I learned about [[Markdown syntax]] and how to use [[Tags]] in my notes.
```

---

## Types of Links

- **Internal links:** Connect to other notes in your vault using `[[Note Title]]`.
- **Aliased links:** Use a pipe to display different text: `[[Note Title|Custom Text]]`.
- **Section and block links:** Link to a specific heading or block: `[[Note Title#Heading]]` or `[[Note Title^blockid]]`.

---

## Backlinks

Obsidian automatically tracks backlinks—notes that link to the current note. View backlinks in the sidebar to see all related notes, even if you didn’t add a link in this note.

---

## Why Link Notes?

- Build a network of related ideas and topics
- Make it easy to find related information
- Discover new connections and insights
- Obsidian can visualise links between notes using the [Graph View](12_graph_view).

{% include gallery.html images="assets/graph.png" titles="Graph View" noborder=true smalltitle=true cols=2 %}

---

## Tips for Effective Linking

- Link notes as you write to build context
- Use links for related concepts, projects, or references
- Review backlinks regularly to discover connections you might have missed

---

By linking your notes, you turn your vault into a true knowledge graph—making it easier to explore, connect, and grow your ideas over time.
