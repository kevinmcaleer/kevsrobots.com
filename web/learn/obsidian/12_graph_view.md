## Graph View in Obsidian

Obsidian’s Graph View is a powerful tool that lets you visualize the connections between your notes. It provides a dynamic, interactive map of your knowledge base, making it easy to see how your ideas and topics are linked together.

---

## What is Graph View?

Graph View displays your notes as nodes and the links between them as edges. This visual representation helps you:

- Identify clusters of related notes
- Spot orphaned notes (notes with no links)
- Explore relationships and discover new connections

You can view the graph for your entire vault or focus on a local graph for a single note.

---

## How to Use Graph View

1. Open the Graph View: Use the command palette (Cmd+P or Ctrl+P) and search for "Open Graph View", or click the Graph icon in the sidebar.
2. Explore the Graph:
   - Zoom in and out to see more or fewer notes.
   - Click on a node to focus on a specific note and its connections.
   - Use filters to show or hide tags, folders, or specific notes.
3. Local Graph: To see the connections for just one note, open the note and click the "Open local graph" button in the sidebar.

## Customizing Graph View

Obsidian allows you to customize the appearance and behavior of the graph:

- Filters: Show or hide notes by tag, folder, or link type.
- Display Settings: Adjust node size, link thickness, color, and more.
- Search: Find specific notes or connections within the graph.

---

## Why Use Graph View?

Graph View is especially useful for:

- Visual learners who benefit from seeing connections
- Writers and researchers building a knowledge base
- Anyone wanting to discover patterns and relationships in their notes

Take some time to explore your own vault’s graph and see what new insights you can uncover!
