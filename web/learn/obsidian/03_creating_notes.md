## Creating Notes in Obsidian

Notes are the building blocks of your knowledge base in Obsidian. Each note is a Markdown file that you can create, edit, and organize however you like.

1. Click the **"New note"** button (the pencil and note icon) in the sidebar, or press `Ctrl+N` (`Cmd+N` on Mac).
2. Give your note a descriptive title, such as "Project Ideas" or "Meeting Notes".
3. Start typing your content. Obsidian saves your notes automatically as you write.

---

## Renaming and Moving Notes

- To rename a note, right-click on it in the file explorer and select **Rename**.
- To move a note, drag it into a different folder in the file explorer.

---

## Formatting Your Notes

Obsidian uses Markdown for formatting. You can add headings, lists, links, images, and more. For a full guide, see the [Markdown in Obsidian](10_markdown_in_obsidian) lesson.

## Tips for Effective Note-Taking

- **Keep notes short and focused:** Create a new note for each topic or idea.
- **Use links:** Connect related notes using `[[note name]]` to build your knowledge network; The note doesn't even have to exist yet!
- **Add tags:** Use tags (e.g., `#project`, `#idea`) to group and find notes easily.
- **Organize with folders:** Group notes by project, topic, or context.

---

## Deleting Notes

To delete a note, right-click on it in the file explorer and select **Delete**. Deleted notes are moved to the system trash/recycle bin.

With these basics, youâ€™re ready to start capturing your ideas and building your personal knowledge base in Obsidian!
