`MicroPython` is a smaller version of the programming language `Python`, designed for use with MicroControllers: `Micro` + `Python`

`Python` gets it name from a TV show...
> *“When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from ‘Monty*
> *Python’s Flying Circus’, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was*
> *short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python”*
>
> – docs.python.org

## MicroPython background
MicroPython was created by Damien George, with the initial release launched on 3 May 2014. It's actually a program that runs on MicroControllers, and is itself written in the C language.
