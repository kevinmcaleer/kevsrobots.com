## Operators

---

Operators are the symbols such as `+` and `-`.

There are **many** types of operators, and we use them to do things like add numbers together, compare numbers and variables, and do some more advanced things that python is good at, like managing `sets`. We'll look at those in later tutorials.

Here is a list of all the operators available. Don't worry if this is overwhelming, you don't need to know many, and you probably already know a few of the [arithmetic ones](#arithmetic-operators).

Have a look through these, but don't worry, there isn't a test!
