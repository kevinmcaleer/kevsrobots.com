You could write MicroPython code in `NotePad` (on `Windows`), or `TextEdit` (on `macOS`), however it is better to use a MicroPython editor, also known as a `development environment`, to create code.

The development environment will enable you to create faster, more accurate code, with features such as autocomplete, code hinting (it tells you what the code means) and line numbering. Most development environments also have code highlighting where the words you type change colour based on their meaning within the code.

Here are a list of development environments:

* [`VS Code`](https://code.microsoft.com) - Microsoft Visual Studio Code (My personal favourite)
* [`PyCharm`](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [`MU`](https://codewith.mu)
* [`Thonny`](https://www.thonny.org)
* [`Microsoft Makecode`](https://www.makecode.com)
* [`Arduino IDE`](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) (Yes! it can do MicroPython too)
