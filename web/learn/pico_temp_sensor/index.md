## Welcome to the Course

In this course, you'll learn how to use the Raspberry Pi Pico's built-in temperature sensor to measure and display temperature readings. Whether you're a complete beginner or looking to explore new MicroPython applications, this course provides the perfect starting point to get hands-on experience with the Pico.

---

## Course Overview

We'll begin with the essentials, including setting up your Raspberry Pi Pico and installing MicroPython. From there, you'll dive into the functionality of the Pico's built-in temperature sensor and understand how it works under the hood.

Once the basics are covered, you'll write your first script to take temperature readings and display them in the Thonny console. We'll then explore ways to enhance the project, such as formatting the data and adding real-world applications like temperature alerts.
