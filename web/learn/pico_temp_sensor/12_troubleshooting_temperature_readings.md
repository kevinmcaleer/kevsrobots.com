## Introduction

Even the best-designed systems can encounter issues. This lesson will guide you through diagnosing and resolving common problems you may face with your Raspberry Pi Pico temperature monitoring system.

---

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. **Inaccurate Temperature Readings**

   **Symptoms**:

   - Temperature values appear much higher or lower than expected.
   - Temperature fluctuates wildly.

   **Possible Causes**:

   - The temperature sensor is measuring the Pico chip's temperature, which may be affected by heat from the board itself.
   - Incorrect conversion formula.

   **Solutions**:

   - Ensure the Pico is not under load (e.g., running intensive scripts) during measurements.
   - Verify the conversion formula is correct:

     ```python
     temperature = 27 - (voltage - 0.706) / 0.001721
     ```

   - Test the readings in a stable room temperature environment and compare them with a thermometer.

---

### 2. **No Readings Displayed**

   **Symptoms**:
   - Thonny console shows no output or an error message.

   **Possible Causes**:
   - The script isn’t running properly.
   - The ADC pin initialization is incorrect.

   **Solutions**:
   - Check that the ADC pin is correctly initialized:

     ```python
     sensor_adc = machine.ADC(4)
     ```
   - Verify the script is saved and run in Thonny.
   - Restart the Pico by unplugging and reconnecting it.

---

### 3. **Temperature Readings Do Not Change**

   **Symptoms**:
   - Temperature stays constant regardless of changes in the environment.

   **Possible Causes**:
   - ADC readings are not being updated.
   - Sensor data is not being processed correctly.

   **Solutions**:
   - Add debugging statements to ensure the ADC values are being updated:

     ```python
     print(f"Raw ADC Value: {raw_value}")
     ```
   - Verify the while loop is executing:

     ```python
     count = 0
     while True:
         print(f"The loop is running {count}")
         count += 1 # Increment the count
     ```

---

### 4. **Script Crashes or Freezes**

   **Symptoms**:
   - The script stops responding or Thonny freezes.

   **Possible Causes**:
   - Infinite loop or too many prints in a short time.
   - Thonny struggling to handle high-frequency updates.

   **Solutions**:
   - Add a delay to the loop:
     ```python
     time.sleep(1)
     ```
   - Limit the frequency of printed messages by updating only when necessary.

---

### 5. **Voltage Conversion Issues**

   **Symptoms**:
   - Voltage values seem too high or too low.

   **Possible Causes**:
   - Incorrect formula for converting ADC to voltage.
   - Miscalibrated ADC range.

   **Solutions**:
   - Ensure the correct formula is used:
     ```python
     voltage = raw_value * 3.3 / 65535
     ```
   - Test the ADC separately by feeding a known voltage to verify accuracy.

---

## Debugging Tips

1. **Use Debugging Prints**:
   - Print intermediate values like `raw_value`, `voltage`, and `temperature` to pinpoint where the issue lies.

2. **Simplify the Script**:
   - Strip down your script to just the ADC reading and print functions to isolate the problem.

3. **Check Hardware Connections**:
   - Ensure the Pico is properly connected to your computer.
   - Verify the Pico is running MicroPython by checking the Thonny interpreter settings.

4. **Restart the System**:
   - Unplug and reconnect the Pico to reset it.
