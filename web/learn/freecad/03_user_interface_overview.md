## Navigating the Interface

- **Zoom, Pan, and Rotate:** Practice these essential navigation controls to view your models from different angles.
- **Custom Views:** Learn how to save custom views for quick access during complex projects.

---

## Customizing the Interface

- **Adjusting Toolbars:** Customize which tools are visible and how they are arranged to streamline your workflow.
- **Setting Preferences:** Modify preferences to suit your design habits, including unit display and default file locations.
