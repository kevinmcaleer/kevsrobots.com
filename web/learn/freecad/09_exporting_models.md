## Introduction to Local Testing

Building and testing locally are crucial steps in the CAD design process, allowing you to identify and address issues before moving to production or sharing your models. This lesson covers the tools and techniques in FreeCAD for effective local testing and iteration.

## Key Testing Tools in FreeCAD

1. **Simulation Tools:**
   - FreeCAD includes tools for simulating mechanical movements and interactions, such as the FEM (Finite Element Method) workbench for stress analysis.

2. **Rendering and Visualization:**
   - Use FreeCAD's rendering tools to visualize your models under realistic lighting and materials. This can help identify visual aspects that need adjustment.

3. **Model Checking and Validation:**
   - Use FreeCADâ€™s built-in checking tools to validate the geometry and ensure there are no errors such as non-manifold edges or intersecting faces.

## Steps to Test a Model

### Example Project: Verifying a Mechanical Joint

- **Component:** A hinge mechanism.

---

### Testing Process

1. **Geometry Check:**
   - Run a geometry check to ensure all parts fit together without overlaps or gaps that aren't part of the design.

2. **Simulation:**
   - Set up a simulation to see how the hinge moves. Ensure that the movement is smooth and the range of motion is correct.

3. **Stress Analysis:**
   - Use the FEM workbench to perform a stress analysis on the hinge under expected loads to ensure it will hold up under use.

4. **Adjustments:**
   - Based on the simulation results, make necessary adjustments to the hinge design to improve performance or correct issues.

## Practical Exercise: Building and Testing a Gearbox

- **Objective:** Construct a gearbox assembly and run a series of tests to verify its operation.
- **Steps:**
  - Assemble the gearbox using the skills learned in previous lessons.
  - Check for geometric accuracy.
  - Simulate the gearbox operation to ensure all gears mesh correctly without undue stress or misalignment.

## Lesson Assignment

Design a simple mechanical device (such as a clamp or vise) and perform a series of tests to ensure it functions as intended. Document the testing process and any modifications made to the design based on the tests.
