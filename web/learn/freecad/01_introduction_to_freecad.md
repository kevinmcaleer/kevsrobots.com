## Welcome to FreeCAD

FreeCAD is a powerful, open-source parametric 3D modeler made primarily to design real-life objects of any size. Parametric modeling allows users to easily modify designs by going back into their model history and changing parameters.

---

## Brief History

Developed by a community of passionate developers and users, FreeCAD's open-source nature means it is continuously evolving. It began in 2002 and has grown to be a dependable tool in engineering, architecture, and product design.

---

## Exploring the Interface

Take a moment to open FreeCAD and familiarize yourself with the interface. Notice the different workspaces tailored to various tasks.
