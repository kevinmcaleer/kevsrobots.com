## Introduction to 3D Shapes in FreeCAD

This lesson introduces the creation of basic 3D shapes in FreeCAD, providing a foundation for more complex designs. You'll learn how to use different tools within the Part Workbench to create shapes like cubes, spheres, cylinders, and cones.

---

## Tools for Creating Basic Shapes

1. **Box (Cube):**
   - Tool: `Create Box`
   - Steps: Click on the tool, then click in the 3D view to place the box. Adjust dimensions in the property editor.

2. **Cylinder:**
   - Tool: `Create Cylinder`
   - Steps: Select the tool, click in the 3D view to set the base, then drag up to define the height.

3. **Sphere:**
   - Tool: `Create Sphere`
   - Steps: Click the tool, then click in the 3D view to place the sphere. Specify the radius in the property editor.

4. **Cone:**
   - Tool: `Create Cone`
   - Steps: Choose the tool, click in the 3D view to set the base, then drag to adjust the height and top radius.

## Modifying Basic Shapes

- **Moving Objects:**
  - Use the `Move` tool to reposition your shapes within the 3D view.
- **Rotating Objects:**
  - Select the `Rotate` tool to adjust the orientation of shapes around specified axes.
- **Scaling Objects:**
  - With the `Scale` tool, you can resize your shapes non-uniformly or uniformly.

---

## Practical Exercise: Creating a Simple Model

- **Task:** Create a simple house model using boxes for the structure and a cone for the roof.
- **Steps:**
  - Use multiple `Create Box` tools to form the walls and base.
  - Place a `Create Cone` on top for the roof.
  - Modify dimensions to fit the shapes together cohesively.

## Lesson Assignment

Experiment by creating a simple scene using the basic shapes discussed. Try combining multiple shapes to form a more complex object. Adjust their positions, orientations, and sizes to achieve your desired design.
