## Introduction to Practical Applications

Now that you've learned the basics of FreeCAD, it's time to put your skills to the test with practical applications. This lesson focuses on integrating best practices into your workflow to enhance your efficiency and accuracy in design.

---

## Practical Examples

1. **Architectural Design:**
   - **Project:** Design a simple two-room cottage.
   - **Application:** Use the Arch workbench to create walls, windows, and doors. Explore the use of different materials and render the final design.

2. **Mechanical Engineering:**
   - **Project:** Design a bicycle frame.
   - **Application:** Utilize the Part Design and Assembly workbenches to model each component and assemble them. Conduct stress analysis to ensure durability.

3. **Product Design:**
   - **Project:** Create a new ergonomic mouse.
   - **Application:** Employ the Sketcher and Part Design workbenches for the initial shape, then use boolean operations for fine-tuning details.

## Best Practices in FreeCAD

1. **Use Templates and Macros:**
   - Save time by creating templates for frequently used designs and macros for repetitive tasks.

2. **Organize Your Workspace:**
   - Maintain a clean and organized workspace by properly naming objects and using layers or groups to manage visibility.

3. **Regularly Save and Backup:**
   - Protect your work by regularly saving and creating backups, especially before making major changes.

4. **Utilize Keyboard Shortcuts:**
   - Speed up your workflow by learning and using FreeCADâ€™s keyboard shortcuts.
