## Design & Engineering

How to build a robot.

Building a robot requires:

- A design or blueprint
- Practical skills
- Materials & parts - wheels, filament, glue, 
- Tools & Machinery, a 3d printer
- Time, Patience and practice

SMARS is a 3d Printed Robot, the designs can be found at:

## Programming

**What is a program?**

- A program is a list of human-readable instructions for the computer to carry out
- A program is written in a computer language, such as Python, Javascript, C++
- Programs can also constructed visually, using blocks in software such as Scratch

An example program, written in Python:
