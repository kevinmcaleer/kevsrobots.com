# How does a Robot think?
## The Robot Brain

---

- Most robots have a computer or micro-controller to perform the instructions from the program
- The ‘brain’ could just be a simple circuit, without a central processing unit (CPU)
- Common microcontrollers include:
    - BBC micro:bit
    - Raspberry Pi Pico
    - Arduino Uno
    - NodeMCU (ESP8266)

A BBC micro:bit; Visit <https://www.microbit.org> for more about this amazing device.
