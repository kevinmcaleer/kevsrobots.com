## Welcome to the Course

In this comprehensive course, you'll embark on an exciting journey to build and program a robot arm using the Raspberry Pi, the PCA9685 servo driver board, and Python. Whether you're a beginner in robotics or looking to expand your skill set, this course is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in robotics engineering and programming.

---

## Course Overview

We'll start with the basics, setting up your Raspberry Pi and getting familiar with Python programming. From there, you'll learn about the PCA9685 boardâ€”a versatile servo driver that allows for precise control over multiple servos simultaneously.

As we progress, you'll dive into the mechanical design and assembly of a 4-servo robot arm. You'll gain hands-on experience in constructing a functional robot arm, from choosing the right materials to assembling the servos and connecting them to the PCA9685 board.

## What You Will Learn

- **Raspberry Pi Setup:** Configuring your Raspberry Pi for robotics projects.
- **Python for Robotics:** Programming basics with a focus on controlling hardware.
- **PCA9685 Servo Driver:** Understanding and using the PCA9685 board for servo control.
- **Robot Arm Construction:** Designing and assembling a robot arm.
- **Servo Control:** Programming your robot arm to move with precision.

---

## Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Understand the components and electronics involved in building a robot arm.
- Program a Raspberry Pi to control servos using Python.
- Design and assemble a simple robot arm using 4 servos.
- Apply your knowledge to create custom movements and tasks for your robot arm.

We're excited to have you on this journey. Let's start building!
