One of Podman‚Äôs strongest features is its **Docker CLI compatibility**. In most cases, you can use the exact same commands ‚Äî often by simply replacing the word `docker` with `podman`.

This makes switching from Docker to Podman easier than you might expect.

## üß™ Try It: Podman vs Docker Commands

| Task                        | Docker Command                  | Podman Command                 |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Run a container             | `docker run -it alpine`         | `podman run -it alpine`        |
| List running containers     | `docker ps`                     | `podman ps`                    |
| List all containers         | `docker ps -a`                  | `podman ps -a`                 |
| Build an image              | `docker build -t myapp .`       | `podman build -t myapp .`      |
| View logs                   | `docker logs <id>`              | `podman logs <id>`             |
| Stop a container            | `docker stop <id>`              | `podman stop <id>`             |
| Remove a container          | `docker rm <id>`                | `podman rm <id>`               |
| Remove an image             | `docker rmi <image>`            | `podman rmi <image>`           |

> üß† **Tip:** You can even create an alias:
> ```bash
> alias docker=podman
> ```

---

## üîç What‚Äôs the Same?

- Most of the Docker CLI commands
- Image management using `pull`, `push`, `build`
- Container lifecycle management (`run`, `exec`, `rm`, `stop`, `logs`)
- Volume and network handling

---

## üîÑ What‚Äôs Different?

### üîß No Daemon

Podman commands run directly without a background service. This affects:

- How containers are started and monitored
- How logs and container state are handled

### üõ† Rootless by Default

Most Podman installations use rootless mode:

- Your containers run as your user (no `sudo` needed)
- Files created by containers belong to your user

> üìÅ Volumes and files created in containers are owned by the current user, not `root`, in rootless mode.

### üß∞ System Commands

Some Docker-style commands (e.g., `docker system prune`) may behave differently or be absent in Podman. Podman provides alternatives like:

```bash
podman image prune
podman container prune
````

---

## üß™ Try It Yourself

Start a container and explore the CLI:

```bash
podman run -it --rm alpine
```

Inside the container:

```sh
apk add curl
```

Then exit and try listing and removing the container:

```bash
podman ps -a
```

---

## üîê Rootless vs Rootful Mode

You can choose to run Podman in root mode if needed:

```bash
sudo podman run ...
```

But in most cases, rootless mode is safer and preferred ‚Äî especially for development.
