It’s time to put your knowledge into practice! In this hands-on project, you’ll migrate a simple Docker-based application to Podman, step by step.

You’ll see how to:

- Convert a Docker Compose setup to Podman
- Use `podman-compose` or pods directly
- Add systemd integration
- Run everything rootlessly

---

## 🎯 Project Goals

By the end of this project, you will have:

- Replaced `docker` commands with `podman`
- Converted a `docker-compose.yml` to `podman-compose`
- Created a rootless pod
- Generated a systemd service to manage your container

---

## 📁 Step 1: Clone the Sample App

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/docker-migration-demo.git
cd docker-migration-demo
````

This app contains:

* `docker-compose.yml`
* A simple web app (Node.js or Flask)
* A Redis backend

---

## 🔁 Step 2: Run with Podman Compose

Install `podman-compose` if you haven’t already:

```bash
pip3 install podman-compose
```

Then run:

```bash
podman-compose up
```

Inspect the generated pod:

```bash
podman pod ps
```

Check logs:

```bash
podman logs <container-id>
```

---

## 🛠 Step 3: Migrate to Native Podman Commands (Optional)

Create a pod manually:

```bash
podman pod create --name myapp -p 8080:80
```

Start your containers inside the pod:

```bash
podman run -dt --pod myapp --name redis redis
podman run -dt --pod myapp --name webapp myapp-image
```

---

## ⚙️ Step 4: Add Systemd Integration

Generate a systemd unit file:

```bash
podman generate systemd --name webapp --files --restart-policy=always
```

Move it into place:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user
mv container-webapp.service ~/.config/systemd/user/
systemctl --user daemon-reexec
systemctl --user enable --now container-webapp.service
```

Repeat for other services as needed.

---

## 🔐 Step 5: Verify Rootless Configuration

Ensure no root privileges are required:

```bash
whoami
podman ps
```

You should see your containers running under your user.

---

## ✅ Project Complete

You’ve now fully migrated a Docker-based app to Podman:

* ✅ Replaced Docker CLI
* ✅ Used `podman-compose` or pods
* ✅ Enabled rootless containerization
* ✅ Integrated with systemd for background service management

---

## 🚀 Challenge

Try deploying another project with:

* Kubernetes YAML (via `generate kube`)
* A more complex `docker-compose.yml`
* Additional features like volume mounts, secrets, or health checks
