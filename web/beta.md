## Welcome to the Learning Platform Beta Program

First of all, thank you for taking interest in this Beta Program.

---

Your help will enable the course to be a world class tutorial, and also shape the new learning platform from KevsRobots.com.

We need help reviewing:

* correctness of code
* course content
* course navigation
* look and feel

To provide feedback, please add comments to the Beta issue on the GitHub:

<https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/kevsrobots.com/issues/9>

You'll need to have a free Github account to create comments.

## How to access the new course content

On the website menu, you'll notice a new [`learn`](/learn/) item. Click this and you should be presented with 2 courses:
1. `How to use the learning platform` - take this first
2. `Learn MicroPython` - the main course I'd like you to test

There is also a special private channel in our [discord](https://www.kevsrobots.com/discord) server, click [here](https://www.kevsrobots.com/discord) to sign up if you're not already a member (its free!).


Ok - head over to [Learn](/learn/) to start the beta.
