## Welcome to the Learning Platform Beta Program

First of all, thank you for taking interest in this Beta Program.

Your help will enable the course to be a world class tutorial, and also shape the new learning platform from KevsRobots.com.

We need help reviewing:

* correctness of code
* course content
* course navigation
* look and feel

To provide feedback, please add comments to the Beta issue on the GitHub:

<https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/kevsrobots.com/issues/9>

You'll need to have a free Github account to create comments.
