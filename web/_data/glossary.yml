    Capacitance is the ability of a body to store an electrical charge.
    Any object that can be electrically charged exhibits capacitance.
    A common form of energy storage device is a parallel-plate capacitor.
    In a parallel plate capacitor, capacitance is directly proportional to the surface area of the conductor plates and inversely proportional to the separation distance between the plates.

- term: Inductance
  definition: Inductance
  full: >-
    In electromagnetism and electronics, inductance is the property of an electrical conductor by which a change in electric current through it induces an electromotive force (voltage) in the conductor.
    It is called self-inductance to distinguish it from mutual inductance, which is the property of a circuit whereby a change in electric current in one circuit produces an electromotive force in another circuit.

- term: Diode
  definition: Diode
  full: >-
    A diode is a two-terminal electronic component that conducts primarily in one direction (asymmetric conductance); it has low (ideally zero) resistance in one direction, and high (ideally infinite) resistance in the other.
    A diode vacuum tube or thermionic diode is a vacuum tube with two electrodes, a heated cathode and a plate, in which electrons can flow in only one direction, from cathode to plate.
    A semiconductor diode, the most common type today, is a crystalline piece of semiconductor material with a p–n junction connected to two electrical terminals.

- term: Transistor
  definition: Transistor
  full: >-
    A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is composed of semiconductor material usually with at least three terminals for connection to an external circuit. A voltage or current applied to one pair of the transistor's terminals controls the current through another pair of terminals. Because the controlled (output) power can be higher than the controlling (input) power, a transistor can amplify a signal. Today, some transistors are packaged individually, but many more are found embedded in integrated circuits.
