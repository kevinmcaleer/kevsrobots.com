- term: Hall effect
  definition: Hall effect
  full: >-
    Hall effect encoders are sensors that use the Hall effect to detect the angular position of a rotating object. 
    The Hall effect is a phenomenon in which a voltage is created when a magnetic field is exposed to a current carrying conductor. 
    In a Hall effect encoder, a magnet is attached to the rotating object, and a Hall effect sensor is placed near it. 
    As the object rotates, the magnetic field changes and the Hall effect sensor detects these changes. 
    The output of the sensor is then used to measure the angular position of the object.
