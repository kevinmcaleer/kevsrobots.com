Hey Robot Makers!

I wanted to give you an update on the direction of my channel for 2026. After much thought, I've been considering whether to stick with my current content style, twist things up with new formats, or even fold the channel altogether.

TLDR - I'm twisting; I'm going to switch to fortnightly pre-recorded videos instead of weekly livestreams.

This is for several reasons:

- **Difficult** - to produce a quality video and project on a weekly basis
- **Effort** - Always preparing for next livestream (difficult to get ahead)
- **Views** - Livestreams don’t perform well (i.e. most people don’t watch them)
- **Impact** - Livestreams tend to be over an hour in length, which is a big time commitment for viewers; less people watching means less impact
- **Quality** - Don’t feel like I’m producing quality content (feels rushed) - not producing the content I’d like to produce
- **Growth** - Channel growth has slowed last year, which doesn’t feel great when I put a lot of effort into each video
- **ROI** - Cost of putting a livestream together

So, after much consideration, I've decided to switch to a fortnightly pre-recorded video format. This change will allow me to focus on creating higher quality content that I believe will be more engaging and valuable for you all.

I've struggled with this decision; I'm a people pleaser and I love interacting with you all during livestreams. However, I believe this change will ultimately lead to a better experience for everyone.

### My Personal Mission

My personal missions is to get more people building robots, learning to code, and having fun with technology. I want to inspire and empower people to create their own projects, and to share my knowledge and experience with the community.

I want to produce the resources to support people on their journey, whether they are beginners or experienced makers - I do this through kevsrobots.com, my YouTube channel, and other social media platforms.

### New Format (2026 Onwards)

{% include gallery.html images="/assets/img/blog/2026channelupdate/channel13.jpg,/assets/img/blog/2026channelupdate/channel14.jpg" cols="1" %}

So going forward, I will be producing pre-recorded videos every two weeks. This will allow me to focus on creating higher quality content that I believe will be more engaging and valuable for you all.

### Leveling up my own skills as a content creator

I want to improve my video editing, scripting, and production skills to create more polished and professional videos. This will help me to better communicate my ideas and projects, and to make my content more enjoyable to watch.

I'm not a great editor yet, its one of the reasons I've stuck with livestreams for so long. But I want to get better, and I believe that pre-recorded videos will give me the opportunity to do so.

I appreciate all the support you've given me so far, and I'm excited about this new direction for the channel. Stay tuned for more updates and content coming your way soon!
