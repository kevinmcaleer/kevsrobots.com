## Meet Chip

`Chip` the Cute Humanoid Interactive Pal, is a small, 3d printable robot you can build yourself. Its powered by the Pimoronoi Servo 2040 (there aren't many boards that have 18 Servo sockets), and programmed in MicroPython.

## Inspiration and idea - Why I designed this robot

![Chip Slide](/assets/img/blog/chip/chip03.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-100"}

I want to make a small bipedal robot for experimenting with walking and gestures.
I also want to make one similar to:

* Plen
* Robosen
* EZ-Robot
* Called Chip - because it will sit on my shoulder…

Chip will be made up of:

* 19 Servos (Yikes - will be expensive)
* 3D printable
* Powered by RP2040 based Pimoroni Servo 2040
* MicroPython
* Detects movement and responds
* Capable of many gestures; Walking, Pointing,Waving, Clapping, Running, Crawling

## Future plans

---

I've a couple of plans for Chip -

* Walking Cycle with IMU for Balance
* Fun Animations & Behaviours
* MicroPython Library for Chip
* Course on KevsRobots.com on how to build

## Download the 3D printable STL files

To make printing the files easier, I've bundled the mirrored parts together:

* [chip_arms.stl](/assets/stl/chip/chip_arms.stl) - Arm servo holders
* [chip_feet.stl](/assets/stl/chip/chip_feet.stl) - Feet
* [chip_head.stl](/assets/stl/chip/chip_head.stl) - Head
* [chip_torso_cover.stl](/assets/stl/chip/chip_torso_cover.stl) - Torso Cover
* [chip_torso.stl](/assets/stl/chip/chip_torso.stl) - Torso
