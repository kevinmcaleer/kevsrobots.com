In August last year (2024) I [created a Raspberry Pi Pico powered PCB](/blog/gamepad2) that could be used as a bluetooth remote control for your robot. The project was a lot of fun to build and I learned a lot about PCB design and the Pico.

However its taken until this week for me to writeup the project and update the code for you to use. I've also added a few new features to the PCB, including an OLED display and a few extra buttons.
