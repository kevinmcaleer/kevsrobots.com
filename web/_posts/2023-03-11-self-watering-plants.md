## 3d design

---

I've designed some cute Geometric plant pots with integrated drainage holes, feed-tube input an sensor holder.

This is the second interation of the design, the first version caused the self watering system to mis-read the sensors as the sensor was not deep enough into the soil to take a proper reading, and instead kept watering the plant until the water supply ran out.

![Enviro Grow Holder](/assets/img/blog/halapeno9000/growholder02.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-50"}

The Grow Hat Mini is mounted on top of a Raspberry Pi Zero W, which is intern mounted on a [Pi Stand](/blog/pistands.html).

## Assembly

The Grow Hat Mini, or Enviro grow connects to the 3 soil moisture sensors, and also to the three water pumps, and each water pump connects to a plant pot (ensure that the sensor and pump are connected to the same plant - A, B & C).
