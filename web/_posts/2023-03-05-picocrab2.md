Picocrab was a project I created a while back; it used a [PCA9685](/resources/glossary#pca9685) board along with a Raspberry Pi Pico. The robot had no space inside for a battery and no power board either. I abandoned that design as the Fusion 360 model was a bit of a mess and needed a lot of work.

## PicoCrab 2.0

I recently purchased the Elecfreaks Wukong 2040 board for the Raspberry Pi Pico. Its a great board for robotics projects - you will find my [review of it here](/reviews/wukong-2040).
