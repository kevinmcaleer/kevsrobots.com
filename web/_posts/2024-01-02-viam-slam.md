## About thsis project

In this project, we will use Viam to map a room using SLAM, and then use the map to navigate the room.

## Viam SLAM

[Viam](https://www.viam.com) is an easy to use robotics platform, that provides simple software building blocks and web-based tools for building machine learning models, and naviation systems using SLAM and computer vision systems. Viam can run on a Raspberry Pi models 3 and up, or on a desktop computer.

## What is SLAM?

`SLAM` stands for [Simultaneous Localization and Mapping](/resources/glossary#slam). It is a technique used by robots and autonomous vehicles to build a map of an unknown environment, while at the same time keeping track of their current location within the map. The SLAM algorithm is based on the Kalman filter, which is a mathematical algorithm that uses noisy sensor measurements to produce a good estimate of the state of a system. In the case of SLAM, the system is the robot, and the state includes the robotâ€™s location and the locations of landmarks in the environment.

SLAM uses a Lidar sensor to capture a 2D map of the environment. The Lidar sensor is mounted on the robot, and as the robot moves around the environment, the Lidar sensor captures a series of scans. Each scan is a 2D point cloud, which is a set of points in the form of (x, y) coordinates. The SLAM algorithm uses these scans to build a map of the environment, and to locate the robot within the map.

## Cubie-1

I created [Cubie-1](/cubie-1) with SLAM and navigation in mind. Cubie has a Slamtec RPLidar A1 mounted on top, and a Raspberry Pi 4 inside. The Raspberry Pi runs Viam, and the Lidar is connected to the Raspberry Pi via USB. Cubie is powered by a USB power bank.

## Setting up SLAM in Viam

To set up SLAM in Viam, we need an existing robot project. If you don't have one, you can create one by following the [Viam Getting Started Guide](https://docs.viam.com/getting-started/).

Once you have a robot project you will also need a supported Lidar sensor. I chose the Slamtec RPlidar A1. These often come with a USB connector maching it easy to connect to the Raspberry Pi.
