I recently received a carepackage from Waveshare with a number of their Compute Module 5 boards. I have been using the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 for a number of projects and I was excited to see what Waveshare had to offer. The boards are affordable and have a number of features that make them great for a variety of projects.

## Compute Module Projects

I've used Compute Modules in a few projects previously - the [Atari 2600 IO Dev Board Case](/blog/atari-2600.html), and an unfinshed Camera project I'll continue working on soon.

The [XGO Robot Dog](/reviews/xgo.html) also featured a CM5 module, though you'd never know as it's tucked away in the head of the robot.
