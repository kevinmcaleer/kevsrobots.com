## What are Cyberbricks?

CyberBrick is a modular smart toy ecosystem that combines programmable hardware, 3D printable structures, and dual-level coding environments. 

It is where 3D printing collides with electronics and coding through LEGO-like simplicity. CyberBrick empowers anyone to build and enjoy a wide range of 3D-printed projects, from R/C toys to productivity tools.

### Four Concepts of Cyberbricks

There are four aspects to Cyberbricks:

1. **Modular Hardware** - core, shields, input & output modules
2. **3D-Print Framework** - designed for easy assembly and customization, with open design specs and reference models
3. **Dual-Level Coding** - App-based configuration and MicroPython programming
4. **Open Source Community** - share and explore projects

Cyberbricks are manufactured by Makerworld, which is a subsidiary of Bambu Labs - [Cyberbricks Website](https://makerworld.com/en/cyberbrick).

## My thoughts

I'm excited by the Cyberbricks system, and am impressed by the value engineering into making the core board, shields and modules affordable. The use of the ESP32 C3 microcontroller means that Cyberbricks can run MicroPython, which is a big plus for me as a MicroPython advocate. 

I'll be looking to develop some Cyberbricks projects in the near future, so stay tuned for more updates!
