## Buddy Jr.

I created Buddy Jr as a troubleshooting step with a larger Robot arm project I'm working on called Buddy (Buddy is the name of one of the robot arms Tony Stark uses in the movie Ironman). I wanted something that is really quick to print so I can test out different methods of moving the arm. The larger robot arm Buddy takes around 8 - 10 hours to print each individual part (with an arm peice being around 4 parts each), Buddys arm takes around 40 minutes to print.

## Design goals

When designing Buddy Jr, I wanted to create a robot arm that was:

- Conceptually simple
- Quick to print
- Easy to assemble
- Fun to play with
- Asthetically pleasing to look at
- Cheap to build
- Functional
- Educational
- Able to hold a Raspberry Pi camera module

## Design

I used Fusion 360 to design Buddy Jr. The design is simple and consists of 4 servos, a base, a shoulder, an elbow, and a camera holder. The servos are controlled by a PCA9685 servo driver board, which is connected to a Raspberry Pi 5 (though any Pi with header pins will do).

### Base

## Assembly

The assembly of Buddy Jr is straightforward. The servos are screwed into the base, shoulder, and elbow, and the camera holder is attached to the elbow. The servos are then connected to the PCA9685 board, which is connected to the Raspberry Pi.

## Download the 3D printable STL files

Here are the files you will need to make this project:

- [`buddy_jr_base.stl`](/assets/stl/buddyjr/buddy_jr_base.stl) - The base of the robot arm, with space to mount the PCA9685 board
- [`buddy_jr_base_pivot.stl`](/assets/stl/buddyjr/buddy_jr_base_pivot.stl) - The shoulder of the robot arm
- [`buddy_jr_basic_arm.stl`](/assets/stl/buddyjr/buddy_jr_basic_arm.stl) - The elbow of the robot arm, print 2 of these
- [`buddy_jr_camera_holder.stl`](/assets/stl/buddyjr/buddy_jr_camera_holder.stl) - The camera holder for the Raspberry Pi camera module
