## Ahoy Arduino Makers!

Got a new course for you that's been highly requested - **[Arduino to MicroPython: A Quick Start Guide](/learn/arduino_to_python/)**!

If you've been curious about MicroPython but felt intimidated starting from scratch, this course is specifically designed for you. We'll translate your existing Arduino knowledge into MicroPython quickly and painlessly.

## Why This Course?

You already know how to blink LEDs, read sensors, and control motors with Arduino C++. Why learn the same things again? This course **builds on what you already know** with side-by-side code comparisons that show exactly how Arduino concepts translate to MicroPython.

**Arduino C++ you know:**
```cpp
digitalWrite(13, HIGH);
delay(1000);
```

**MicroPython equivalent:**
```python
led.on()
time.sleep(1)
```

See? Not so different!

## What You'll Learn

In just **2-3 hours**, you'll master:

- ✅ Python syntax (with Arduino comparisons)
- ✅ Pin control, ADC, and PWM
- ✅ Timing and serial communication
- ✅ Building IoT projects with WiFi
- ✅ Creating robot control systems

## Works With Your Hardware

The course supports:
- **Arduino Nano ESP32** - Your Arduino with MicroPython!
- **Raspberry Pi Pico W** - Affordable and powerful
- **Raspberry Pi Pico 2W** - The latest and fastest

All examples work on these boards with minimal tweaks.

## Who Is This For?

**Perfect if you:**
- ✅ Know Arduino C++ programming
- ✅ Want faster development (no compile time!)
- ✅ Like cleaner, more readable code
- ✅ Need WiFi/IoT features
- ✅ Want to teach others (Python is easier for beginners)

**You DON'T need:**
- ❌ Python experience (we'll teach you!)
- ❌ Linux knowledge
- ❌ Advanced programming skills

## Course Structure

**11 bite-sized lessons** organized into 4 sections:

1. **Getting Started** - Why MicroPython matters
2. **Language Fundamentals** - Syntax, control flow, functions, pins
3. **Hardware Basics** - ADC, PWM, timing, serial
4. **Practical Projects** - IoT and robotics projects

Each lesson includes hands-on exercises you can try with your board.

## Why MicroPython?

**Faster Development:**
- No compile time - run code instantly
- Interactive REPL for testing
- Live code changes without re-uploading

**Easier to Read:**
- Less boilerplate code
- Clearer syntax
- Better for collaboration

**More Powerful:**
- Built-in WiFi libraries
- File system support
- Easy string manipulation

**Still Use Arduino C++ When:**
- You need microsecond-precise timing
- Working with very limited RAM
- Using Arduino-only libraries

## Ready to Start?

Head over to **[Arduino to MicroPython](/learn/arduino_to_python/)** and begin your MicroPython journey!

Whether you're looking to speed up your development, make your code more maintainable, or just expand your skills - this course has you covered.

**Happy Making!** 🐍🤖
