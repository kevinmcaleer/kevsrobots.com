## Give your homelab server superpowers with n8n

Ahoy there makers! Ready to supercharge your Raspberry Pi with powerful automation capabilities? Today we're diving into **n8n**, an incredible workflow automation tool that can connect hundreds of services, APIs, and even run local AI models on your Raspberry Pi.

---

## What is n8n?

**n8n** (pronounced "nodemation") is an open-source workflow automation tool that lets you connect different services and create powerful automations without writing code. Think of it as a visual programming environment where you can:

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Connect APIs and services
- Build chatbots and AI assistants
- Process data from multiple sources
- Create custom integrations

The best part? It's completely free and open-source, and you can self-host it on your Raspberry Pi!

---

## Hardware Requirements

For basic n8n workflows, any Raspberry Pi 4 or newer will work. However, if you plan to use **Ollama for local AI** (which I highly recommend), you'll want:

### Recommended Setup

- **Raspberry Pi 500+** (or Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB RAM)
- Minimum 32GB microSD card (or better yet, an NVMe SSD)
- Stable network connection
- Docker installed

> **Why Raspberry Pi 500+?**
>
> The Pi 500+ has enough memory and processing power to run both n8n and Ollama comfortably. Running local AI models requires significant resources, and the Pi 500+ handles this beautifully.

---

## What You'll Need

- Raspberry Pi (500+ recommended for AI features)
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- Basic understanding of Docker
- GitHub account (to access the ClusteredPi repository)

---

## Setting Up n8n with Docker

I've created ready-to-use Docker Compose configurations for both n8n and Ollama in my [ClusteredPi repository](https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/ClusteredPi). Let's set them up!

---

> ### Note
>
> The username I use on my Pi's is `kev` - this will appear in the docker-compose.yml files so be sure to change it to your own username if different.

---

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/ClusteredPi.git
cd ClusteredPi/stacks/n8n
```

### Step 2: Start n8n

The docker-compose configuration is already set up and ready to go:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This will:
- Pull the latest n8n image
- Create persistent storage for your workflows
- Start n8n on port 5678

### Step 3: Access n8n

Open your browser and navigate to:

```
http://your-pi-ip:5678
```

You'll be greeted by the n8n setup wizard. Create your admin account and you're ready to go!

## Adding Ollama for Local AI

Want to add AI superpowers to your workflows? Let's set up Ollama to run local language models right on your Pi!

### Step 1: Navigate to Ollama Stack

```bash
cd ~/ClusteredPi/stacks/ollama
```

### Step 2: Start Ollama

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

### Step 3: Pull an AI Model

Once Ollama is running, you can pull a language model. I recommend starting with a smaller model:

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama2
```

For the Pi 500+, you can try larger models:

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull mistral
```

or a newer model of llama:

```bash
docker exec -it ollama ollama pull llama3.2
```

## Connecting n8n to Ollama

Now for the magic - connecting n8n to your local AI!

1. In n8n, create a new workflow
2. Add an **HTTP Request** node
3. Configure it to connect to Ollama:
   - **Method**: POST
   - **URL**: `http://ollama:11434/api/generate`
   - **Body**: JSON with your prompt

Example workflow:
- Trigger: Webhook or schedule
- Action: HTTP Request to Ollama
- Response: Process AI output

---

## Example Use Cases

Here are some awesome things you can build with n8n and Ollama on your Pi:

### 1. Smart Home Assistant
- Connect to your home automation sensors
- Use AI to analyze patterns
- Trigger actions based on AI insights

### 2. Document Processor
- Monitor a folder for new documents
- Use Ollama to summarize or categorize
- Save results to a database

### 3. Social Media Bot
- Monitor RSS feeds or social media
- Generate responses using local AI
- Post automatically

### 4. Personal AI Assistant
- Create a webhook for your phone
- Ask questions via HTTP request
- Get AI-powered responses from your local model

---

## Docker Compose Configuration

Both configurations are available in my ClusteredPi repository:

- **n8n**: [`ClusteredPi/stacks/n8n/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/ClusteredPi/tree/main/stacks/n8n)
- **Ollama**: [`ClusteredPi/stacks/ollama/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/kevinmcaleer/ClusteredPi/tree/main/stacks/ollama)

These configurations include:
- Persistent storage volumes
- Network configuration for container communication
- Environment variables for easy customization
- Health checks and restart policies

---

## Tips for Success

### Performance Optimization

1. **Use an SSD**: Running Docker containers from an NVMe SSD dramatically improves performance
2. **Monitor Resources**: Use `docker stats` to keep an eye on CPU and memory usage
3. **Start Small**: Begin with smaller AI models and scale up as needed

### Security Best Practices

1. **Change Default Ports**: Consider using a reverse proxy
2. **Set Strong Passwords**: Use the n8n authentication features
3. **Regular Backups**: Export your workflows regularly
4. **Network Security**: Use firewall rules to restrict access

### Troubleshooting

**n8n won't start?**
- Check logs: `docker logs n8n`
- Ensure port 5678 isn't already in use
- Verify disk space: `df -h`
- check the permissions on the /home/<username>/n8n folder, you may need to `chown` it to the user `1000`:
  ```bash
  sudo chown -R 1000:1000 /home/<username>/n8n
  ```

**Ollama running slowly?**
- Try a smaller model
- Check available RAM: `free -h`
- Ensure you're using a Pi 500+ for best results

---

## Going Further

Once you've got n8n and Ollama running, explore these advanced features:

- **n8n Community Nodes**: Extend functionality with community-built integrations
- **Webhooks**: Trigger workflows from external services
- **Scheduled Workflows**: Automate recurring tasks
- **Error Handling**: Build robust workflows with error recovery
- **Multiple AI Models**: Run different models for different tasks
