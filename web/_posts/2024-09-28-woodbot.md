## WoodBot - a Laser-cut robot

I recently built a new robot called WoodBot. It's a small robot that I designed and built using my [Creality Falcon 5W laser](/blog/robots-and-lasers) cutter. The robot is made from 2mm plywood and is powered by an Arduino Uno microcontroller.

I designed this to learn more about how to use a laser cutter and to experiment with different materials. I'm really pleased with how it turned out, and I'm looking forward to building more robots in the future.

## Design

The robot is designed to be simple and easy to build. The body is made from 2mm plywood, which is cut using the laser cutter. The wheels are attached to the motors, and the motors are controlled by an Arduino Uno microcontroller. The Arduino is lifted above the body using hex standoffs, which gives the robot a bit of height.

The robot is powered by a 4xAA battery box, which is connected to the Arduino using jumper wires. The ultrasonic distance sensor is mounted on the front of the robot, and is used to detect obstacles in front of the robot.

## Construction

The robot is simple to put together, you may need some wood glue to secure the tabs and range finder parts in place, and some hot glue to secure the motors driver and battery box.

---

## Wiring

The diagram below shows how the robot is wired up. The motors are connected to the motor driver, which is connected to the Arduino.

The DRV8833 motor driver is connected to the Arduino using 4 GPIO Pins. The TT motors are connected to the motor driver outputs. Test the motor directions are correct, if they move in the wrong direction, swap the motor output wires around.

The ultrasonic distance sensor is connected to the Arduino, and the battery box is connected to the Arduino and motor driver using jumper wires.

The Range finder has 4 pins, VCC, GND, TRIG, and ECHO. The VCC and GND are connected to the Arduino 5V and GND pins. The TRIG and ECHO are connected to the Arduino GPIO pins.

> The code is a work in progress, the GPIO pins will be confirmed once the code is complete.

## Programming

The robot is programmed using the Arduino IDE and the C++ programming language.
