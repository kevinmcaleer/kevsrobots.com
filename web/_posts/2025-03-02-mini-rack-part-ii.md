In Early February 2025 I started work on my own [Raspberry Pi 10" Mini-Rack](/projects/mini-rack). In this part 2 of the mini-rack project, we will finish the design with the `Pi Tray`, `Top Panel` and `Front Cluster Panel`.

## Pi Tray

The Pi tray holds the Raspberry Pi in place with 4x M2.5 nuts and bolts. There are two versions of the Pi Tray, one for the Raspberry Pi 4 and one for the Raspberry Pi 2,3 & 5 (the Ethernet connector is swapped top to bottom). The Pi Tray is designed to be mounted on the front cluster panel.

## STL files

To keep all the project files in one place - I've update the [original Mini-Rack Project Page](/projects/mini-rack) with the new STL files for the Pi Tray and the Top Panel. You can download them from there.
