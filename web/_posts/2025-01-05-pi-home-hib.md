`Project Chihuahua` is a Raspberry Pi Home Hub that I built using a Raspberry Pi 4 and a 7" touchscreen display. The Home Hub is a central place in my home where I can control all my smart devices, check the weather and news headlines. It's a fun project that combines hardware and software to create a useful and interactive device.

> I call this project ***Chihuahua*** because it's small, cute, and always there when you need it. Just like a Chihuahua!

## Kivy

I used the [Kivy](https://kivy.org) framework to create the user interface for the Home Hub. Kivy is an open-source Python library for developing multitouch applications. It's cross-platform and supports Android, iOS, Linux, OS X, and Windows. Kivy is easy to use and has a wide range of widgets and tools for creating interactive applications.

## Aims for this project

I wanted to create a Raspberry Pi-based Home hub, like Amazons Echo Show or Google Nest Hub, but with more control over the software and privacy. I wanted to be able to:

- **Display a large clock** - with temperature and current weather icons
- **Control my smart devices** - showing data from sensors around the house
- **Check the weather** - from OpenWeatherMap
- **Read the news headlines** - from an RSS feed of my choosing

 I also wanted to be able to customize the interface and add new features as I go.

---

## Designing the User Interface

I designed the user interface for the Home Hub using Kivy's `kv` language. The `kv` language is a declarative language that allows you to create user interfaces in a simple and intuitive way, and even store this configuration in a `app.kv` file. I created a main screen with navigation buttons for navigating to other screens.

## Screens

- **Home Screen** - Will display the top 5 headlines from an RSS feed - I'm going to use the BBC news feed for this.
- **Weather Screen** - This widget will show the 5 day weather forecast for my location. I'm going to use OpenWeatherMap for this
- **Smart Devices Screen** - I will create a Chart widget that will display data from my smart devices. All of my sensors send data to an MQTT server on my network, so I can simply subscribe to the topics and display the data in a chart.
- **Home Screen** - Shows the Clock & Weather widget along with a menu button to navigate to the other screens and a background image.

## Challenges with this project

First of all, it does run a litle slower than expected on Raspberry Pi 4 and the original 7" touchscreen display. 

Secondly I spent way too long messing about with layouts and moving widgets around. Expect this, but make it easier by doing all this in the `.kv` file.
