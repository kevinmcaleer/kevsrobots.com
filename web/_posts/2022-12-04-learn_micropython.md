## The new Learning Platform is now Live

You'll notice there is a new [Learn](/learn/) item on the main menu navigation. This is the gateway to the brand new Learning Platform.

The Learning Platform enables courses to be built and published using a simple folder structure and accompanying course content. More about this below.

## Learn MicroPython

`Learn MicroPython` starts with the very basics of programming in MicroPython, explaining each concept as they are introduced and building upon previous knowledge with each new lesson. It's designed for people new to programming or just new to MicroPython. 

This new course is the reason I built the Learning Platform.

The course is broken into individual lessons, each with a singluar focus. The course is very easy to navigate with a clear structure always visible on the left hand side (when viewed on a desktop browser).

This course is also accompanied with a series of bite-sized videos to help bring the content to life.

## More to come

I'll be using the new Learning Platform to provide build instructions for more complicated builds; builds that are too big for a typical blog post.

## Feedback is always welcome

I'd love to hear what you think about the course content, the Learning Platform itself, and any features you'd like to see added in the future. The best way to provide this feedback is via our [Discord server](/discord).
