`Tiny FX` is a microcontroller board from the geniuses at [Pimoroni](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/tiny-fx) that allows you to add lights and sound to your LEGO builds. It uses a Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip, and is designed to be easy to use with MicroPython.

I recently turned 50 and received the Jaws LEGO set as a gift. I wanted to add some lights and sound to it, so I decided to use the Tiny FX board to do this.

The Jaws Lego set is [Jaws 21350](https://www.lego.com/en-gb/product/jaws-21350) and is from the LEGO Ideas range. It is a great set, and I wanted to add some lights and sound to it to make it more interactive. The kit costs around Â£129.

The Tiny FX board fits perfectly into the cabin of the boat, and I was able to add a blinking light to the barrel. I also added a selection of movie clips when the motion sensor is triggered, which plays the iconic Jaws theme music and some of the famous lines from the movie.

## MicroPython

The code for this is available on GitHub, and you can find it [here](https://www.github.com/kevinmcaleer/jaws-tinyfx). The code is written in MicroPython, and is designed to be easy to use with the Tiny FX board.

The Pimoroni documentation for the Tiny FX board is excellent, and you can find it on GitHub [here](https://github.com/pimoroni/picofx). It includes examples of how to use the board with MicroPython, and how to control the lights and sound.
