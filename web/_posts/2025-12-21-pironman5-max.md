The [Sunfounder Pironman 5 Max](https://www.sunfounder.com/collections/raspberry-pi-5-cases/products/pironman-5-max) is a versatile and robust case designed specifically for the Raspberry Pi 5. In this review, we will explore its features, build quality, and overall performance to help you determine if it's the right choice for your Raspberry Pi projects.

## Design and Build Quality
The SunFounder Pironman 5 Max has a two-part design consisting of a sturdy aluminium base and a transparent front and side cover. The aluminium base provides excellent heat dissipation, which is crucial for maintaining optimal performance of the Raspberry Pi 5 during intensive tasks. The transparent cover allows for easy monitoring of the board and adds a sleek aesthetic to the overall design. It also allows the RGB fan lights to shine through, adding a touch of flair to your setup.

The case is well-constructed, with precise cutouts for all ports and connectors, ensuring easy access without the need to remove the case. The assembly process is straightforward, requiring only a few screws to secure the cover to the base.

## Cooling Performance

Pironman 5 Max comes equipped with a two built-in RGB fans as well as a large processor heatsink and fan. This combination provides effective cooling for the Raspberry Pi 5, helping to prevent thermal throttling during heavy workloads. The fans are reasonably quiet during operation, though they are audible.


The aluminium base also contributes to passive cooling, further enhancing the overall thermal management of the case.

## SD Card Access

One of the standout features of the Pironman 5 Max is its convenient SD card access. The case includes a dedicated slot that allows users to easily insert and remove the SD card without having to disassemble the case. This is particularly useful for those who frequently swap out SD cards for different projects or operating systems.

---

## Dual NVMe Support

The Pironman 5 Max case supports dual NVMe SSDs, allowing users to expand their storage options significantly. This feature is particularly beneficial for users who require high-speed storage for applications such as media servers, gaming, or data-intensive projects. The case provides secure mounting points for the NVMe drives, ensuring they remain stable during operation.

It also means you can run the Hailo-8 AI accelerator alongside NVMe storage.

---

## Dual HDMI Support

The case is designed to accommodate the Raspberry Pi 5's dual, full-size HDMI outputs, making it an excellent choice for users who need multi-display setups.

---

## Media Center remote control via IR receiver

Pironman also has an IR receiver built into the front panel, allowing for remote control functionality. This is a great addition for media center applications, where users can easily navigate their media library from a distance.

---

## GPIO Access

The case provides easy access to the Raspberry Pi 5's GPIO pins through a dedicated externder port. This allows users to connect various peripherals and accessories without having to remove the case, making it ideal for projects that require GPIO connectivity.

---

## Safe on/off via power button

The case features a power button that allows users to safely power on and off the Raspberry Pi 5. This is a convenient feature that helps prevent data corruption by ensuring that the system is properly shut down before powering off.

## Basic Pi 5 Case

I've created a simple alternative case design called the Basic Pi 5 Case that you can 3D print yourself. It provides essential protection and access to all ports while being easy to print and assemble.
