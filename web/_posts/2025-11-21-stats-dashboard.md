## Ahoy there makers!

I've got something cool to share with you today - a brand new **public stats dashboard** for KevsRobots.com!

You know what I love about the maker community? **Transparency**. We share our code, our designs, our failures, and our successes. So why not share the website analytics too?

## What's the Stats Dashboard?

The [new stats dashboard](/stats) is a completely transparent view into what's happening on KevsRobots.com. No login required, no paywalls - just pure data about what makers like you are searching for, viewing, and enjoying.

### What You'll Find

The dashboard shows:

- **📊 Real-Time Metrics** - Total visits, searches, and user counts (updated every hour!)
- **🔍 Popular Searches** - See what topics makers are searching for right now
- **📈 Trending Searches** - Discover what's gaining momentum week-over-week
- **📄 Most Viewed Pages** - Find out which tutorials and projects are most popular
- **🌍 Visitor Locations** - See where our global maker community comes from
- **💻 Device & OS Stats** - Breakdown of how people access the site
- **📅 Historical Trends** - Search patterns over the last year

## Why Did I Build This?

Honestly? **Because it's useful for everyone.**

### For You (The Maker)

- **Discover trending topics** you might want to learn about
- **Find popular projects** that other makers love
- **See what the community is interested in** right now
- **Validate your project ideas** by checking if others are searching for similar topics

### For Me (Content Creator)

- **Understand what tutorials you actually want**
- **Spot gaps** in the content I'm providing
- **See which projects resonate** with the community
- **Make data-driven decisions** about what to create next

It's a win-win!

## The Tech Behind It

For the nerds out there (I see you 👋), here's what powers the dashboard:

- **DuckDB Analytics** - Open-source analytics
- **Chart.js** - Beautiful, responsive charts
- **Hourly Updates** - Fresh data every 60 minutes
- **No Cookies** - We track anonymized data only
- **GDPR Compliant** - Respecting your privacy

The best part? Everything you see on that dashboard is **real data** from actual visitors. No inflated numbers, no vanity metrics - just honest stats.

## Some Interesting Findings

Since launching the dashboard, I've already spotted some fascinating patterns:

**Popular Searches Include:**
- Raspberry Pi 5 projects (no surprise there!)
- MicroPython tutorials
- Docker and home server setups
- 3D printing guides
- Robot building tutorials

**Trending Topics:**
- AI and machine learning on Raspberry Pi

It's really cool seeing what the community is passionate about!

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add more features to the dashboard:

- **Search term details** - Click a search to see related content
- **Time-of-day patterns** - When is the site busiest?
- **Popular content categories** - Robotics vs Programming vs Electronics
- **Content suggestions** - Based on searches with no results
