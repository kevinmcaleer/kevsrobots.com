When I created the Explora robot, and later Cubie-1 Robot, I used the `RPLidar A1` Lidar sensor. These sensors cost around $100 at the time and connected to the Raspberry Pi via USB. The RPLidar A1 is a great sensor, but I wanted to create a robot that was cheaper and easier to build.

LD Robot launched the low cost (I paid £25) `LD06` Lidar sensor on Kickstarter in 2024. The LD06 is a 360 degree Lidar sensor that can be used to create a 2D map of the environment. The LD06 is a great sensor for the price, and I wanted to create a robot that could use it.

## LidarBot

LidarBot is a proof of concept robot that uses the `LD06` Lidar sensor to detect obstacles and navigate around them. The robot is built using the Raspberry Pi Pico and the Kitronik Motor Driver board.

I based the robot's chassis on BurgerBot, as its quick to print and easy to modify. The robot uses two DC motors to drive the wheels, and the Lidar sensor is mounted on the front of the robot. The DC motors are connected to the Kitronik Motor Driver board, which is controlled by the Raspberry Pi Pico.
