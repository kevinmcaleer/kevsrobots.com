## Overview
The Pi Stand is a single-piece 3d printable holder for Raspberry Pi 2, 3b, and 4b based computers.

It features four raised mounting points that can be used to attach the Raspberry Pi using 4 M2 screws.

The stand is tilted to optimise the viewing angle of displays often included on pHats, such as the [Pimoroni Grow Hat](https://www.pimoroni.com/grow),[Pimoroni Enviro+ Hat](https://www.pimoroni.com/enviro), and so on.

### Printing Tips
It's best to change the orientation of the stand so that the 'face' of the stand is pointing straight down. See the picture below.
