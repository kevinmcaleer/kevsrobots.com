## What is Bubo-2T

Bubo-2T is a robotic owl made in the Steampunk style.

---

> ### Inspiration
>
> Bubo was the name of the clockwork owl in the 1981 movie `Clash of the Titans`. It was animated by Ray Harryhousen.
>
> I've take inspiration from other movies characters such as the Nautilus from the movie 20,000 leagues under the sea.
>
> I was also inspired by Tick Tock - the clockwork tin man from the movie Return to Oz.
>
> My other inspiration are creators of companion robots such as Alex Glow and her Archie robot, Jorvon Moss, and also creators of wearable tech such as Naomi Wu and Sophy Wong.
>
> Bubo-2T features advanced AI and machine learning, and can detect hand gestures made in front of it.

### Features

* 2 large eyes that open and close using 2 servers, one per eye
* Opening and closing mouth
* Each eye contains an Neopixel ring that is animated via a Raspberry Pi Pico
* The Pico is also connected via UART to a Raspberry Pi 4 2Gb
* One of the eyes also contains a Raspberry Pi Camera 3 Wide module
* The camera module enables the user to strike a pose, the hand gestures are detected and the camera will take a picture and tweet it to Twitter or Toot it to Mastodon (thats what the 2T or `tooty` means).
