## My First time as an Exhibitor

In 2023 I'll be attending my first Maker Faire event as an exhibitor. I'll be showing off some of my projects (links below).

I registered my interest as a Latecomer, and was delighted to be accepted; my oroginal expectaiton was just to walk around with [Bubo-2T](/bubo) on my shoulder, however Maker Faire Rome offered me a stand, so I've had to throw together an exhibit!

To make the exhibit more interesting I'll be showcasing some of my projects as well as some interactive experiences too - there is a [Cutebot](cutebot) and Cutebot Pro line following robots for people to play with on a track, there is also a Anemometer project from [Monk Makes](https://www.monkmakes.com/mb_kit_2.html) that people can construct and play with.

## Bubo-2T Travel Case

To protect Bubo-2T from getting damaged in transport, I've created a travel case. Its more of a robust frame made of 20x20 extruded aluminium bar. I also added some RGB LED strip to make it more interesting, as it will stand out. I used a [Pimoroni Plasma Stick 2040 W](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/plasma-stick-2040-w?variant=40359072301139) to animate the lights.
