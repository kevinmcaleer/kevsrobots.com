## Ghostbox Overview

Make your own GhostBox - using a Raspberry Pi Pico.

The world of electronics and programming is constantly evolving and opening up new opportunities for creative minds to come up with innovative ideas. One such idea is the ghost box project which combines the power of the Raspberry Pi Pico and the versatility of MicroPython to create an interactive and spooky gadget.

The ghost box project features light-up living flame LEDs, a random word generator, and an ouijaboard display. The device is powered by the Raspberry Pi Pico microcontroller, a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board that is perfect for hobbyists and professionals alike.

The project is programmed in MicroPython, a lightweight version of the popular Python programming language that is designed for microcontrollers. This makes it easy to develop code for the project, even for those who have limited experience with programming.

The living flame LEDs are one of the most striking features of the ghost box project. These LEDs simulate a flickering flame, adding to the spooky atmosphere of the device. 

The random word generator is another fascinating feature of the ghost box project. It uses a list of pre-defined words, which are randomly chosen and displayed on the ouijaboard display. The display is also controlled using the Raspberry Pi Pico and is designed to resemble a traditional ouijaboard.

The ouijaboard display is made using an OLED (Organic Light Emitting Diode) screen, which provides high contrast and clear visibility even in low light conditions. The OLED display is connected to the Raspberry Pi Pico by simply pushing the Pimoroni display pack onto the header pins of the Pico.

The ghost box project is a great example of how creativity and technology can be combined to create something unique and exciting. The Raspberry Pi Pico and MicroPython provide an excellent platform for hobbyists and professionals alike to explore the possibilities of electronics and programming.

If you're interested in building your own ghost box project, this article will provide the resources you need to help you get started. Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, you're sure to find something that will inspire you and help you to create something truly amazing.

## Assembly

1. Print out the [STL files](#download-the-3d-printable-stl-files)
1. Cut the power 9v Battery connector off the the LED Living Flame lights, leaving about 5-10cm of cable remaining on the connector
1. Thread the Living Flame LED lights into the two holes at the top section of the Ghostbox
1. Push fit the Living Flame LED lights onto the ghostbox, they should fit snugly. If they are loose, add a spot of super glue to secure
1. Solder a red wire from the `VBUS` Pin (Pin `40`) to the `5v` on the `buck convertor`
1. Solder a blackwire from the `GND` Pin (Pin `38`) to the `GND` on the `buck convertor`
1. Mount the Pico onto the Bottom section using 4 of the M2 screws, with the headerpins pointing up
1. Solder the Battery Connector to the Switch and the Switch to the buck convertor.
1. Load the [Micropython code](#micropython-code) from the repository below
1. Check the buck convertor is set to output 5v using a multi-meter and adjust using output voltage using the little potentiometer
1. Add the battery to the connector
1. Place the top section over the bottom section and carefully arrange the wires so they are not trapped
1. Screw the bottom section to the top section using the remaining 4 M2 screws
1. Carefully push the Display Pack onto the header pins
1. Switch on and enjoy!
