## v6 Upgrades

The new Pi 4 Stand features an integrated camera module holder, with a GoPro compatible mount point.

This version of the stand is slightly wider than the previous version; this is to comfortably accomodate the [Pimoroni HyperPixel 4.0](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/hyperpixel-4?gclid=CjwKCAiAl9efBhAkEiwA4Toriisspu557V1cQ1dCyQq79vYMjO85RwiaCtif8435TQw_NoLyDcKrGxoCun0QAvD_BwE) rectangular display. The stand is designed so that the display is central and the camera module is also centered above the screen.

The Camera holder is adjustable so you can place this on a desk or workbench and point the camera at whatever you want to monitor.

## Captive Nut

You'll need to add an M4 nut and bolt to secure the Camera module holder to the stand.

> ### Note
>
> Please do not overtighten the nut as it will crush the 3d print and ruin the Pi Stand.
