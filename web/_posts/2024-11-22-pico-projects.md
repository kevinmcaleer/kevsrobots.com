## Introduction

The `Raspberry Pi Pico` was introduced in January 2021 and has since become a popular choice for hobbyists and makers. With its powerful RP2040, and later RP2350, microcontrollers and support for MicroPython, the Pico is a versatile platform for building a wide range of projects.

Meet the family:

## 1. **LED Blink**

The classic "Hello, World!" of microcontroller projects, the LED blink program is a simple way to get started with the Raspberry Pi Pico. By toggling an LED on and off at regular intervals, you can verify that your Pico is working correctly and familiarize yourself with the basics of programming.

## 2. **Temperature Sensor**

Did you know the Pico has a built-in temperature sensor? By reading the temperature value from the sensor, you can create a simple thermometer project that displays the current temperature on an the console.

## 3. **Weather Robot**

<div class="row row-cols-4">

I designed WeatherBot to be a fun robot that can show a tempareture reading in an innovate and unusual way; it uses a servo to point to a value on a dial, on its stomach. It even holds the temperature sensor in its hand, with the wires going to the back of the robot where the microcontroller is housed.

## 8. Wifi Scanner

The Pico W can be used to scan for Wifi networks and display the results on a small OLED display. We can make this extra fun by turning it into a Ghostbusters inspired handheld device.

<div class="row row-cols-4 g-3">
