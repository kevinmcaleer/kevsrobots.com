## PicoCat Origins

**PicoCat** is a remix of ***Opencat***, created by Dr. Rongzhong Li in his dorm room back in 2016. Rongzhong went on to create Bittle, Nybble and the company [Pet IO](https://www.petio.com).

PicoCat is different because its powered by the Raspberry Pi RP2040 chip, either in the Pico form or new [Pimoroni](https://www.pimoroni.com) Servo 2040 board.


## What is PicoCat?
PicoCat is a 3d printable, opensource Cat robot, programmed using MicroPython. 

## Upgrades

### Body
The first upgrade is the new **body**, which is designed to accommodate the Servo 2040 board, which is a tiny bit wider than the original body.

### Servo 2040
The next upgrade is the Pimoroni Servo 2040 - a Raspberry Pi RP 2040 powered servo board, that can connect up to 18 servos, and a bunch of sensors to. Its the perfect size for PicoCat, and combines the MicroController with the Servo interface.

Previously I'd used a regular Raspberry Pi Pico, along with an PCA9685. The problem was that these PCA9685 boards can be a bit finicky, and it can require even more hardware to split the power between the Pico and the PCA9685.

### MicroPython code
Next, I've revisited the MicroPython code, and simplified it somewhat. The RP2040 makes using the servos a lot easier, the servo movements to the correct angles are now much more accurate. [You can find the code here](https://www.github.com/kevinmcaleer/picocat).

## Electronics
PicoCat uses regular servos for each leg, foot, head, neck and tail. All 11 servos are the same type. You can use SG90s, MG90s or DS-929MG servos for the best quality.

## 3D Design & files
I created a couple of videos on how to design the PicoCat:
