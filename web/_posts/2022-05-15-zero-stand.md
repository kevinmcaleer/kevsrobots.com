## Overview

The Zero Stand is a single piece 3d printable holder for Raspberry Pi Zero based computers.

If features four raised mounting points that can used to attach the Raspberry Pi Zero using 4 M2.5 screws.

The stand is tilted to optmise the viewing angle of displays that are often included on pHats, such as the [Pimoroni Grow Hat](https://www.pimoroni.com/grow), [Pimoroni Enviro+ Hat](https://www.pimoroni.com/enviro) and so on.

### Printing Tips

It's best to change the orientation of the stand so that the 'face' of the stand is pointing straight down. See the picture below.
