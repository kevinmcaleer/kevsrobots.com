## 3. Build a Weather Station

**Monitor the weather in your area by building a weather station with your Raspberry Pi.**

If you're a weather watcher, or someone that wants to track the temperature, humidity, and other weather conditions in your area, then building a `weather station` with your Raspberry Pi is a great project. If there is an earthquake or astroid impact you might event detect the pressure wave with a pressure sensor.

To get started you'll need a couple of sensors and a Raspberry Pi to capture, process, store and present the data.

Here are some links to get you started:

<div class="row row-cols-md-3 my-3 g-3">

{% include card.html cardtitle="Pimoroni Enviro Indoor Stevenson Screen case" description="3D Print your own Stevenson Screen for the Pimoroni Enviro Indoor sensor" img="/assets/img/stevenson_screen.jpg" link="https://www.kevsrobots.com/blog/enviro-case.html" type="blog" tl="2" dl="3" %}

{% include card.html cardtitle="How good are Weather Station Sensors?" description="How good are Weather Station Sensors? What can you do with the raw data from the Pimoroni Weatherhat?
