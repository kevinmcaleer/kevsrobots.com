The Learning System has been updated to make it easier to navigate and includes new features. We've added a refreshed Learning Pathways section, which is a collection of related courses designed to flow into the next, building on previous knowledge. 

We've also added a new Learning Pathway for the Raspberry Pi Pico, which includes courses such as "Learn MicroPython - The basics" and "Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython - GPIO Mastery".

## New Navigation & Filter

We've added a new navigation and filter system to help you find the courses you're looking for. You can now filter courses by  category, making it easier to find the courses that are right for you.

Future updates will include filters for skill level too
