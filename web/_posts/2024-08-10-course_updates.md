The Learning System has been updated to make it easier to navigate and includes new features. 

We've also added a refreshed Learning Pathways section, which is a collection of related courses designed to flow into the next, building on previous knowledge. The previous learning system was getting difficult to navigate now that there are over 30 courses available.

The new learning pathways navigation bar is now visible on each of the learning system pages making it easier to navigate between the different pathways. Take a look - this is the live navigation bar:

{% include nav_learning_pathways.html %}

## New Learning Pathways for Pico

## New Navigation & Filter

We've added a new navigation and filter system to help you find the courses you're looking for. You can now filter courses by category, making it easier to find the courses that are right for you.

Future updates may include filters for skill level too.

Check it out now! [Learning System](/learn/)
