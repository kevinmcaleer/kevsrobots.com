## Overview

This project provides a cute retro case for the Compute Module development board and the CM4 module in the style of the Atari 2600, Perfect as a retro gaming platform.

## About the Compute module

I bought the Raspberry Pi Compute Module development board and the CM4 module during the height of the Raspberry Pi shortage that's now, thankfully, coming to an end. The CM4 is similar in specification to the Raspberry Pi 4; however, it can also optionally feature eMMC storage instead of the SD card. The compute modules can also come with or *without* Wifi and Bluetooth.

I opted for the CM4 with 16Gb eMMC and Wifi module.

## 3d Design

The case is made up of 3 pieces:

|        |     
:----------------------------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:------------------------------------------------------------------:
[![Base](/assets/img/blog/atari/base.png){:class="img-fluid w-100"}](/assets/img/blog/atari/base.png) | [![Top](/assets/img/blog/atari/top.png){:class="img-fluid w-100"}](/assets/img/blog/atari/top.png) | [![Front](/assets/img/blog/atari/front.png){:class="img-fluid w-100"}](/assets/img/blog/atari/front.png)
                               Base                               |                               Top                               |                                Front
{:class="table table-borderless"}

Use the wood effect tape to wrap the front piece. This will bring the model to life and give it that retro 70s feel.

Notice the orange/red outline on the front of the top section and the printed decal sticker. In his picture, it looks relatively crude, but from a distance, you can't see that it's a separate piece. The orange/red outline was created using an [acrylic paint pen](https://amzn.to/3FIg6IE).

## Finishing touches

You can add some rubber feet to raise the case off the surface and complete the retro look and feel.
