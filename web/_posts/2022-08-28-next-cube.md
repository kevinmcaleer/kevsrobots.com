## The Next Cube

I created a case for the Pico W, as an homage to the original web server.

* Tim Berners-Lee created the World Wide Web on a Next Cube whilst working at CERN back in 1990
* His idea was to make information easier to navigate and discover using hyper-text
* He developed the web-server, web browser and markup language (HTML) on this computer
