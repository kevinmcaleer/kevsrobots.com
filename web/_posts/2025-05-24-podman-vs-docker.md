I've created a new course on **Podman vs Docker**. This course is designed to help you understand the differences and similarities between Podman and Docker, and how to use Podman effectively.

I've also upgraded the learning platform so that you can now navigate lessons using the `← →` arrow keys on your keyboard. This should make it easier to go through the lessons quickly.
