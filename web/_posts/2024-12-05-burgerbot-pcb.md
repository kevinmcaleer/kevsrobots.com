## Why make a custom PCB?

Creating a custom PCB for BurgerBot has been on my bucket list for at least a year, and last Sunday the audience voted for a mid-week stream. I took this opportinity to design a PCB for BurgerBot v3 live on the stream.

## Design Goals

The goals for the PCB design are:

- Fix the issue with the pen holder server (the previous version didn't have power to the servo when on battery - I know, I know...)
- 5v Power for Servo (pen up and down); its actually 6v because 4x AA batteries will power it
- Option for encoders on motors, or just regular motors ( + / - )
- connectors for motors & power (possbly JST style connectors or just header pin style)
- Ultrasonic range finder connectivity (either through the hole or via a female header pin)
- Raspberry Pi Pico Powered (drop in a Pico H, Pico WH, Pico 2 H or Pico 2 WH)

## Design

I've detailed the design in this [project](/projects/burgerbot) page, which is a new style of project page for the site; it separates out the overview, bill of materials, circuit diagram, wiring, assembly, code and downloadable STL files into separate pages.

If you find this interetsing let me know and I'll do more of these in the future. I'm also considering doing a series of PCB design streams, where we design a PCB for a project live on stream.
