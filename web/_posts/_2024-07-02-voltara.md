Growing up I loved the movie 'Big' with Tom Hanks. The movie featured a mysterious fortune teller named Zoltar who granted the wish of a young boy who wanted to be big.

I always wanted to build my own fortune teller, so I decided to build my own, but with a twist. I wanted to make it a Desktop sized, Raspberry Pi animatronic fortune teller.

## Fleshing out the idea

### The concept

I started with the thermal printed, which I've had in a boring box for a few years - this connected to a Raspberry Pi Zero W, and could be used to print out grey scale images or black and white text. The thermal receipt paper is really cheap and it doesn't need toner or ink to work.

The thermal printer would define the scale of the projects, and I decided to make it a desktop size, so I could have a small animatronic that would move and light up inside.

I also needed to have someway to activate the aninmatronic so decided on a simple arcade button on the front, just underneath the thermal printer.

The top of the fortune teller case would feature a glass enclosure, containing an animatronic figure, something the size of a Barbie doll. The figure would be sat or stood at a table that would have a crystal ball on it, along with some tarot cards, dressed in the style of a fortune teller.

The Raspberry Pi would be running a Python script that would control the thermal printer, the animatronic figure, and the lights.

When the user presses the button, the thermal printer would print out a fortune, and the animatronic figure would tilt her head back and the crystal ball would light up - just like in the movie Big!

## The Design

I used Fusion 360 to model the thermal printer, so I could scale the fortune teller case around it. I also modelled the animatronic figure, the table, and the crystal ball, and the glass case enclosure.

The case would need some holes are the back for the Raspberry Pi to be connected, along with a power socket for the thermal printer as its quite hungry for power, and cannot be connected to the Raspberry Pi as its power requirements are too high.

The thermal printer and arcade button would also need their own holes at the front too.

The animatronic figure would be connected to a servo motor, which would be connected to the Raspberry Pi. The crystal ball would be connected to a small LED, which would also be connected to the Raspberry Pi.

There would also be some lighting provided by some LED noodles (they are so much fun to play with) which would backlight the Voltara Sign.

The Voltara sign would be printed out of Vinyl, cut on a Cricut machine and stuck to the front of the case on all three sides.

Rather than using glass, we decided to use pouring resin to make the glass case. The resin would be poured into the 3d printed front and sides and left to set, creating a clear glass-like case. This turned out really great on first attempt too. We painted the glass enclose parts before pouring the resin, so it would all match - the 3d printed parts were printed in white PLA+ filament and this would show through the resin.

The 3D printed case was made up of:
- a bottom section
- 4 lower sides
- 3 upper sides
- a back panel
- a lid
- a small table with a crystal ball holder
