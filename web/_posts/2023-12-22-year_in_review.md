It's been a busy year. I've been working on a lot of projects, and I've been to my first in person Makers events at the [Makers Central](https://www.makerscentral.co.uk/) in Birmingham UK, as well as the Maker Faire Rome in Italy.

I've create a set of pages that show all the things I've created over the years. You can find them here: [Year in Review](/year_in_review/). These pages automatically generate themselves from the content in the website as I add [videos](/all_videos), [projects](/robots/projects) and [robots](/robots/) to the site.
