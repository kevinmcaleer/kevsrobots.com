## Version 2.0

The `Picotamachibi 2` is a ***Raspberry Pi Pico 2*** powered Virtual Pet with a 1.3" OLED display. It's a fun project that combines hardware and software to create a digital pet that you can interact with. 

The project uses a Pico 2, a 1.3" OLED display, and some MicroPython code to create a virtual pet that you can feed, play with, and take care of.

This is a follow up of the [Picotamachibi 1](/learn/projects/picotamachibi) project, where we built a similar virtual pet using a Raspberry Pi Pico.

The Picotamachibi 2 takes things a step further by using the new Pico 2 board, which has more memory and a faster processor, allowing for more complex interactions and animations.

This project also features a custom PCB that makes it easy to connect the Pico 2 to the OLED display and other components. The PCB includes a breakout for the Pico 2, a breakout for the OLED display, and a breakouts for the 3 control buttons.

## Wiring

The wiring is pretty simple, though you may have to keep the wires short to fit everything in the case.

## Assembly

![Assembly](/assets/img/blog/picotamachibi2/pcb.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-100 card-shadow card-hover rounded-3"}

The assembly of the Picotamachibi 2 is straightforward. You will need to solder the Pico 2 to the custom PCB, solder the OLED display to the PCB, and connect the buttons to the PCB.

## Interface

The Picotamachibi 2 has a simple interface that allows you to interact with your virtual pet. The OLED display shows the pet's status, such as its hunger level, happiness level, and health level.

There are 3 buttons to navigate the Toolbar at the top of the screen.
