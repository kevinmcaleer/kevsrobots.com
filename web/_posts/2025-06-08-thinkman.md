## Parts

For this project I've used a Raspberry Pi 5 16Gb version, a PiSugar 3 Plus battery pack, and a custom 3D printed case. 
The project is designed to be easy to build and use, with a focus on portability and functionality.

## Build instructions

I've written up the project with full install instructions, and you can find the code on GitHub - checkout the project using the card below:
