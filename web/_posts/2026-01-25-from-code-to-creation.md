Ahoy there makers!

I'm thrilled to announce the launch of a brand new video series: **From Code to Creation**!

---

## What's This Series About?

If you've mastered the basics of MicroPython and you're tired of just blinking LEDs, this series is for you. **From Code to Creation** takes you on a journey from simple code examples to building real, practical electronics projects.

We'll be diving deep into topics that every maker needs to understand, starting with communication protocols that let your microcontroller talk to sensors, displays, and other devices.

## Episode 1: Working with I2C

The first episode is out now! In **"Build this next (when you're bored with blinking LEDs) - Working with I2C"**, we explore the I2C protocol - one of the most important communication standards in the maker world.

You'll learn:

- What I2C is and why it matters
- How to connect I2C devices to your Raspberry Pi Pico
- Scanning for I2C addresses
- Reading data from sensors
- Building practical projects with I2C devices
