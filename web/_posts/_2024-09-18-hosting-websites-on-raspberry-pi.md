## Hosting websites on multiple Raspberry Pi

You can host websites from your home with a Raspberry Pi. In this article I'll show you how [KevsRobots.com](https://www.kevsrobots.com) is hosted on 4 Raspberry Pi 5s and what each component of the software stack does.

### Background of KevsRobots.com

Back in 2019 I started a website called [SMARSFan](https://www.smarsfan.com) to document resources relating to the SMARS robot, a 3D printable robot based on the Arduino Uno R3. The website was hosted using github pages and was a static site.

GitHub uses Jekyll to build the website from simple [MarkDown](/learn/markdown) files. I learned how to style pages, and how to use Liquid to create templates. Liquid is a templating language that is used in Jekyll to create reusable components such as headers and footers, navigation and sidebars.

Jekyll also works really well with Yaml, (Yet Another Markup Language) which is a human-readable data language. Yaml is used to store configuration data, and is used in Jekyll to store metadata about the pages and posts. See the Data section below for more info on how thats used in kevsrobots.com.

After becoming familiar with how to build sites using Jeykll, I thought it would be fun to learn how to host the site itself using a Raspberry Pi. I had a few Raspberry Pi 4s lying around, and I thought it would be a fun project to host the site on a Pi. The result was [Clustered-Pi](https://www.clustered-pi.com), a website that documents how to host websites on a cluster of Raspberry Pi 4s. I like puns so Clustered-Pi was a great name for a site about how to cluster Raspberry Pi's.

After learning how to build a website that can run on several Raspberry Pi's (more on this below) I decided to create a site dedicated to robotics, and so [KevsRobots.com](https://www.kevsrobots.com) was born.

## Data

The data for kevsrobots.com is stored in a Yaml file called `_data/robots.yml`. This file contains a list of robots, each with a name, description, image and link to the page. The data is used in the `robots.html` file to create a list of robots with links to their pages.

Jekyll can parse the yaml file, and create a list of robots using a for loop. This is a powerful feature of Jekyll, and allows you to create dynamic content from static data.

KevsRobots has several yaml datafiles including:

File                 | Description
---------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
courses.yml          | A list of all the courses in the learning system (this file is actually generated by a Python program that builds the courses from the markdown files)
