`Facebot` is a cute desktop robot that features a small 8x8 LED Display matrix. It is powered by a Raspberry Pi Pico W, which means we can control this robot using Wifi and/or Bluetooth.

The 8x8 LED Matrix [I2C](/resources/how_it_works/i2c) display is useful for scrolling text, and displaying fun icons and simple animations.

## MicroPython Code

The code for Facebot is available in the Pico SMARS 2 library:

<https://www.github.com/kevinmcaleer/picosmars2>

The library contains the icon images as well as a 5x5 font named 'Jonny Five'.

## Icon Maker

A useful tool for creating your own icons is available with this library - a program called `icon_maker.py` will help you create icons for displaying on your 8x8 Matrix LED screen.

To use the icon maker you will need to setup a virtual environment with the `tk` library installed:

1. From the command line type:

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    ```

1. Activate the virtual environment:

    ```bash
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

1. Install `tk`:

    ```bash
    pip install tk
    ```

1. Run icon_maker:

   ```bash
   python3 icon_maker.py
   ```
