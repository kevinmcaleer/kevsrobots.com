## Version 2.0

The `Gamepad 2` is a ***Raspberry Pi Pico 2*** powered bluetooth remote control for your robot. 
It's a fun project that combines hardware and software to create a digital remote control that you can interact with.

## Bill of Materials

To build the Gamepad 2 you will need the following components:

Item          | Description                       | Quantity |  Cost |  Total
--------------|-----------------------------------|:--------:|------:|------:
Pico          | Raspberry Pi Pico WH or Pico 2 WH |    1     | £4.80 |  £4.80
Buttons       | 6x6x5mm Tactile Switches          |    11    | £0.10 |  £1.10
OLED          | 0.96" OLED Display 128x64 pixel   |    1     | £2.00 |  £2.00
Battery       | 3.7V LiPo Battery 500mAh          |    1     | £5.00 |  £5.00
JST Connector | 2 Pin JST Connector               |    1     | £0.10 |  £0.10
GamePad PCB   | Custom PCB                        |    1     | £6.00 |  £6.00
              |                                   |          |       | £18.00

## Assembly

Push the 11 tact switches into the PCB and solder them in place. The switches are all the same so it doesn't matter which way around they go.

The Pico is mounted on the back of the PCB, and should be soldered from the front.

Notice the little rectanngle on the pcb silkscreen - this indocates the orientation of the Pico, with the micro usb at the top.

A Pico WH or Pico 2 WH is recommended as the little plastic header pin holder lifts the pico off the pcb slightly, allowing room for the USB connector to be easily connected.

Be sure to check the orientation of the power connector, taking note of the + and - symbols on the PCB.

When purchasing the SSD1306 OLED display, be sure to get the 4 pin version - and check that the pins match those on the PCB - GND, VCC, SCL, SDA in that order, some come with the vcc and gnd pins reversed.

## Pinouts

--------------|:------:
UP Button     | GPIO 08
DOWN Button   | GPIO 09
LEFT Button   | GPIO 02
RIGHT Button  | GPIO 03
A Button      | GPIO 06
B Button      | GPIO 07
X Button      | GPIO 04
Y Button      | GPIO 05
MENU Button   | GPIO 10
SELECT Button | GPIO 11
START Button  | GPIO 12
OLED SDA      | GPIO 00

## Software Library

![Features](/assets/img/blog/gamepad2/gamepad05.jpg){:class="w-100 img-fluid card-shadow rounded-3"}

The software for the Gamepad 2 is written in MicroPython and is available on GitHub - <{{page.code}}>

There are 3 classes within the library:

- `GamePad` - the main class that initialises the Pico and the OLED display
- `Buttons` - a class that reads the button presses
- `SSD1306` - a class that controls the OLED display, included as a separete file
- `Motor` - a class that controls the motors on the robot
- `GamePadServer` - a class that runs a bluetooth server on the Pico for use on the robot that connects to the GamePad

To setup your Gamepad, copy the `gamepad.py` file to your pico as well as the `ssd1306.py` file.

There is an example program named `test_butttons.py` that demonstrates how to use the GamePad library - you can even copy this as `main.py` to your Pico and it will run when the Pico is powered up.

## GamePadServer

To use the gamepad to control a robot you will need to copy the `gamepad.py` file to your robot. The `GamePadServer` class will run on the robot and connect to the GamePad. It can check for buttons presses and then respond to them using your own code.

I've included a `test_gamepad` file as an example that works on a [burgerbot](/burgerbot) robot.
