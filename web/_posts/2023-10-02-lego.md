Many Makers begin their journey with **Lego**, either as a child or later as an adult enthusiast. Building models with Lego is both educational and therapeutic.

## Note about 3D Printing compatible blocks

**Lego** blocks are highly accurate, injection-molded ABS plastic bricks. 3D Printers can approximate but rarely match the quality of a store-bought block. As a result, printed parts might not fit as snugly as the official branded ones. As they say, your mileage may vary.

## Dimensions

The standard **block** measures 15.8 by 31.8 (which is essentially 16 x 32, but with a 0.2mm tolerance). The spacing between **studs**, known as the **pitch**, is 8mm.

**Studs** are 1.8mm tall and 4.8mm in diameter.

Block heights are given in **standard units**, which are 3.2mm high. For example, a single block might be described as 4x2, 3.

## Tolerance

The length of a block is calculated as: Number of Studs x Pitch. To allow blocks to fit side by side, a tolerance of `0.2mm` is added.

## Columns

Blocks have columns underneath them to provide structural stability and to aid in connecting blocks together.

The **pitch** between columns is also 8mm, and the formula for the number of **Columns** is: Length - 1, Width - 1.

## Types of Element

There are several types of block, termed elements. These include:

* Bricks
* Plates
* Tiles

You can design all three types of blocks with a single model and parameters using Fusion 360 (as well as other CAD applications). Check the videos above for a comprehensive tutorial.
