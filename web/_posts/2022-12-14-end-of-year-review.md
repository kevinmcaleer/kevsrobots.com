## 2022 was a year of growth and building projects

2022 was a year full of robot projects, interviews, reviews, new product launches and connecting with people. Its late December which is commonly the time to reflect on how things went over the past year.

### Stats

In January 2022 the YouTube channel had `3784` Subscribers, which was a growth of about `2300` from 2021, and the year is closing out with over `12440`, with is a growth of `8616`, which is neary 4 times as much growth as the previous year.

My projects featured in The MagPi Magazine (the official magazine of Raspberry Pi), a number of times:

* Ghostbusters Wi-Fi project
* Cyberdog RGB LED Coat
* Feature on me as a Maker
* Big Mouth Billy Bass project
* Every issue in MagPi Monday section

### Pikon Camera
The Pikon camera project featured in a number of places online:

* [DP Review](https://www.dpreview.com/news/1718918607/the-pikon-camera-is-a-3d-printed-interchangeable-lens-camera-built-around-raspberry-pi)
* [Digital Camera World](https://www.digitalcameraworld.com/news/robot-builder-shares-raspberry-pi-pikon-high-quality-camera-in-3d-printed-casing)

### Pico W launch at Pimoroni HQ

One of the highlights of the year was being part of the Pico W launch at the Pimoroni factory in Sheffield with the team. Throughout the launch day we went live and showcased a number of Pico W based products with Jon, Paul, Niko, Chris and the team. I really enjoyed being part of the launch and getting hands of with it before it was generally released.

You may know that I make Product Introduction videos for the [Pimoroni website](https://www.pimoroni.com), hosted on their YouTube channel.

### Raspberry Pi visit

In November I visited Raspberry Pi Towers in Cambridge, and spent the day with maker in residence, Toby Roberts. It was an absolutely amazing day meeting everyone and spending time with a fellow maker. Toby is great, a really talented maker, and I'm looking forward to working on future projects with him.
