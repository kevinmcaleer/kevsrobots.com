I'm always looking to improve KevsRobots and one feature thats been overdue is `tags`. Tags are labels that can be included in the metadata of each blog article. The intention is that tags can then be used to collate related articles together to make it easier to discover other interesting articles.

Each post has a number of tags in the header:

![Tags](/assets/img/blog/tags/tags01.png){:class="img-fluid w-100"}

Clicking these tags now take you to a tags page, showing related articles.

## Tag Cloud

I've also created a tag-cloud component that shows tags from all the articles published, with a counter for the number of times each tag is featured. The tag cloud only shows tags with counts higher than 2.

Here is the tag cloud component:

{% include tag_cloud.html %}

## Related Articles

I've also added another section to the bottom of blog posts; the Related Articles section. This will present up to 6 related articles that share the same tags (you'll see this below this article too!).
