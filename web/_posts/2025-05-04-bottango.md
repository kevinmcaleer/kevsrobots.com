Bottango is a powerful tool for animating and controlling servos, and it can be used in conjunction with the InMoov robot to create a wide range of interactive projects.

I've created a new course on Bottango which you can find here:

<div class="row row-cols-3">

## What is Bottango?

Bottango (a portmanteau of "`bot`" and "`tango`") is a software platform designed for animating and controlling servos in robotics projects. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating complex animations and interactions, making it an ideal choice for hobbyists and professionals alike.

Bottango is particularly well-suited for animatronics, where precise control of servos is essential for creating lifelike movements. It can be used to animate a wide range of robotic systems, from simple servo-based projects to complex humanoid robots like InMoov.

I plan on using Bottango for some Halloween projects this year, and I will be sharing my progress on the blog. Stay tuned for more updates!
