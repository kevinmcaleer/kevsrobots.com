## Crafting an Atari 2600 Replica

Last year, I embarked on an exciting journey and fashioned a [3D printed Atari 2600 replica](/blog/atari-2600) specifically designed for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 IO board. I opted for the CM4 variant equipped with Wifi, a robust 2GB RAM, and a generous 32GB eMMC storage.

All was well, until one day the CM4 started acting up, refusing to boot as it used to. My first instinct was to blame potential file system corruption or a malfunctioning eMMC. Disheartened, I shelved it for the better part of 8 months.

## Resurrecting the CM4

This weekend's agenda? Resuscitate the CM4. Given their niche nature, there's a conspicuous dearth of CM4 documentation available. My goal was straightforward – erase the current Raspberry Pi setup and infuse life back into the CM4 with a fresh Raspberry Pi OS.

It's worth noting that the CM4's OS refresh isn't the conventional SD Card insertion. The process necessitates specific software, a Micro-B USB cable connection to the IO Devboard, and the motherboard's jumper shifted to target disk mode. For those keen on the intricacies, [Jeff Geerling offers a comprehensive guide](https://www.jeffgeerling.com/blog/2020/flashing-raspberry-pi-compute-module-on-macos-usbboot) detailing each step.

## Embracing Retro Gaming

With the Raspberry Pi OS 64-bit breathing life into the CM4, it was time to realize my initial vision – setting up RetroPie for a nostalgic gaming experience. And what better home for it than a case reminiscent of the Atari 2600?

If you're looking to streamline your RetroPie setup with Samba file sharing on the Raspberry Pi, I've [crafted a guide](/blog/setting-up-samba-for-retropie) to help you through.

## Manual Installation of RetroPie on Raspberry Pi CM4

Taking a slightly different approach, let's manually install RetroPie on the CM4, ensuring that we have the most control over the entire process. This method is akin to setting it up on a regular Raspberry Pi.

---

### Prerequisites

1. **Micro SD Card:** 16GB or larger recommended.
2. **Raspberry Pi CM4** with IO board.
3. **Power supply,** keyboard, mouse, and HDMI monitor.
4. **Internet connection** for necessary downloads and updates.

---

### Steps

1. **Install Raspberry Pi OS:** Begin with a fresh installation of Raspberry Pi OS (formerly Raspbian) on your SD card using software like Balena Etcher or Raspberry Pi Imager.

2. **Initial Boot-Up and Setup:**
   - Insert the SD card into the CM4.
   - Connect your peripherals.
   - Power up the CM4.
   - Follow the on-screen prompts to complete the initial Raspberry Pi OS setup, ensuring you connect to Wi-Fi.

3. **Update & Upgrade:** Open a terminal and run:

    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    ```

4. **Install RetroPie Setup Script:** In the terminal, execute the following commands:

    ```bash
    sudo apt install -y git lsb-release
    git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/RetroPie/RetroPie-Setup.git
    ```

5. **Run RetroPie Setup:** Navigate to the directory and start the setup:

    ```bash
    cd RetroPie-Setup
    sudo ./retropie_setup.sh
    ```

6. **Install from Source:** In the RetroPie-Setup script, choose 'Basic install'. This will install all the core packages. It's a bit time-consuming, but it ensures the latest versions are fetched.

7. **Configure Controllers:** Once installed, launch RetroPie from the terminal with `emulationstation`. On first launch, you'll be prompted to configure your game controller. Hold any button on it and follow the on-screen instructions.

8. **Transferring ROMs:** After RetroPie's core components are set, you'll want to add game ROMs. Remember, only use ROMs you legally own. The earlier Samba method is recommended for easy transfers.

9. **Play and Enjoy:** Navigate to your game, and indulge in retro gaming goodness!

### Tips

- **Performance Tweaks:** Some games might require performance adjustments. Explore the settings of specific emulators if needed.
- **Backups Matter:** As you make more customizations and add more ROMs, remember to back up your SD card. It saves time in case of any future issues.

---

Remember, manual installation provides deeper insights into the process, but it's crucial to follow each step carefully to ensure a smooth gaming experience.
