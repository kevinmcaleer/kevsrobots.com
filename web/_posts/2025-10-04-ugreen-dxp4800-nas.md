## Overview

Ahoy there makers! Before you spend a penny on buying a new NAS, here's two things this box did that really surprised me. And one thing I wish I'd known before I'd started copying files.

Can the UGREEN DXP 4800 Plus replace my Synology 1523 Plus and run Windows 11? Let's find out.

In the past, I've built ZFS and FreeNAS rigs. I daily use the Synology and yes, I've even 3D printed a tiny Snazzy NAS. Today, I'll show you the real pros and cons of the UGREEN DXP 4800 Plus, who it's for, and one setting I will turn on immediately to avoid heartbreak.

## Disclosure

For full transparency, UGREEN sent me this DXP 4800 Plus as well as two 4TB IronWolf hard drives for review.

---

## First Impressions

Out of the box, it's clean and simple:

- **Toolless trays with locks** - no drive lock-ins like other providers
- **Front ports where you want them** - USB-A, USB-C at 10Gb/s, and SD card slot
- **Painless first boot** - UGOS Pro spins up quickly
- **Quiet operation** - thanks to the large fan

---

### Storage Configuration

I tested the UGREEN with two IronWolf 4TB drives in a RAID 1 (mirrored) configuration using the BTRFS file system. This provides redundancy - if one drive fails, your data is safe on the other.

---

## UGOS Pro Software

The software runs on UGOS Pro with apps for:

- Windows
- macOS
- iOS
- Android
- TV
- Web browser

### What You Can Do

- **Docker containers** - Run your favourite containerised apps
- **Virtual machines** - Yes, I've even spun up Windows 11
- **AI-powered photo album** - Clusters faces, objects, and scenes
- **Remote access** - Through UGREEN Link

---

## Remote Access with UGREEN Link

I tried this out recently when visiting the Isle of Jersey. This is me accessing files and also the Windows 11 desktop remotely.

To access your UGREEN NAS remotely:

1. Navigate to [`ug.link`](https://ug.link) in your browser
2. Type in the name you gave your NAS during setup
3. Enter your password

You're presented with a really nice user interface via a web browser, despite the Linux-based backend.

---

## File Management

### Folder Types

The Files section lets you set up three types of folders:

- **User folders** - As an administrator, you can see all different users
- **Personal folders** - Unique to each individual user
- **Shared folders** - Where you can share access permissions

Creating a new shared folder is simple:

1. Click the plus button
2. Choose network folder or new shared folder
3. Select which volume to use
4. Set optional quota limits
5. Choose visibility in network view
6. Enable/disable recycle bin
7. Set admin-only access if needed
8. Configure user permissions (read/write/no access)

---

## Control Panel Features

### File Services

The control panel provides access to all parts of your NAS:

- **SMB** - Windows and Mac file sharing
- **FTP/SFTP** - File transfer protocols (off by default for security)
- **NFS** - Network filing system for Unix systems
- **Rsync** - Remote synchronization protocol
- **WebDAV** - Web-based file sharing
- **Time Machine** - Backup your Macs
- **UPnP Discovery** - Make device discoverable on network

---

### Device Connection

Configure how your NAS connects to the network:

- **Hostname** - Give your NAS a friendly name
- **Terminal Access** - SSH with auto-shutdown after 10 minutes for security
- **Network Settings** - DNS, gateways, static IP configuration

---

### Hardware and Power

Control the physical aspects:

- **Buzzer** - Audio notifications for power on/off
- **Fan Mode** - Quiet, default, or full power (the fan is extremely quiet - I've not been able to hear it at all)
- **LED Brightness** - Adjust for dark environments
- **Power Management** - Balance, energy saving, or high performance
- **Memory Compression** - Reduce physical hardware requirements

---

## Security Features

Security isn't a checkbox, it's a workflow:

- Encryption
- Flexible RAID configurations
- Real-time virus scanning
- Granular permissions
- All local - you know exactly where your data lives

---

## The App Ecosystem

One of the really cool features is the entire app ecosystem. Installing apps is incredibly easy:

1. Open the App Center
2. Browse available apps
3. Click Install
4. Choose storage location
5. Done!

Available apps include:

- Virtual Machine Manager
- Text Editor
- Sync & Backup
- Photos
- Music
- Media Center
- Web Browser (Firefox)
- Docker
- Jellyfin
- And many more

---

## Running Virtual Machines

One of the standout features is the ability to run virtual machines. I've got both Windows 11 and Ubuntu running.

### Setting Up a VM

1. Install the VM Manager app
2. Upload your ISO image
3. Configure RAM and CPU allocation
4. Install UGREEN Guest Tools for better performance
5. Connect via the web browser interface

### Windows 11 Performance

Now, it is a little bit slow to be fair. This is because I reduced the RAM allocation to run more virtual machines simultaneously. You can upgrade the RAM on your UGREEN NAS, which allows you to run more virtual machines with better performance.

One thing I was **not** able to do on my Synology NAS was run Windows 11. It just couldn't do it. The UGREEN has no problems at all thanks to the 12th gen Intel CPU, the DDR5 memory, and the secure chip.

**Note**: Windows 11 on this NAS is not really for gaming. This is more for office or admin use. I use it for Microsoft Project.

---

## That One Critical Setting

The one setting I said to flip - let me show you where it is.

### SMART Test Setup

This is **crucial** for avoiding heartbreak:

1. Go to **Storage** → **Hard Drives**
2. Select a drive → **Status Test**
3. Click **SMART Test Plan**
4. Create test plans:
   - Weekly quick test
   - Monthly extended test
   - Quarterly complete test

These tests run in the background and ensure there are no errors causing your disc to perform badly. If there are any errors, you'll get a notification with a red bubble alerting you to the issue.

**This is essential** - you want to know about drive problems before they cause data loss.

---

## Apps I Really Like

### Universal Search

Makes it really easy to find stuff on your entire NAS drive. No more hunting through folders trying to remember where you saved something.

### Sync & Backup

Really useful for making copies of your NAS. **Important**: Even though you've got RAID, one drive can fail. You want to make sure you've got extra copies of your stuff just in case the worst should happen.

### The 3-2-1 Rule

You should follow the 3-2-1 backup rule:

- **3** copies of your data
- **2** different types of storage (maybe one cloud, one physical)
- **1** offline copy (not physically connected to your network all the time)

---

## Who Is This For?

### Family Use

The UGREEN DXP 4800 Plus is perfect for family use:

- **Shared storage** - Your entire family can share the NAS
- **Private areas** - Everyone can have different areas that are private
- **Media storage** - Store family content, TV shows, music in shared areas
- **Device backup** - Back up your Macs and Windows machines
- **Quiet operation** - So quiet you could have it in the living room under the TV

---

### Home Lab Enthusiasts

If you're into home servers and self-hosting:

- Docker support for running services
- Virtual machines for testing
- 10Gb networking for fast transfers
- NVMe cache for improved performance
- Plenty of expansion options

---

## Pricing

When I looked online recently, it was **£599** for the diskless version.

---

## Can It Replace a Synology?

For my use case, the UGREEN DXP 4800 Plus offers some compelling advantages:

**Pros:**
- More powerful processor (can run Windows 11)
- Upgradeable RAM
- Front USB-C at 10Gb/s
- Quieter operation
- Slightly lower price point
- No vendor lock-in on drives

**Cons:**
- Less mature software ecosystem
- Smaller community support
- Newer to the market

For **family use** and **home lab** scenarios, the UGREEN is an excellent choice. For enterprise use, you might want to stick with established brands for now.

---

## Final Thoughts

I'd like to know in the comments:

- How do you use a NAS drive if you've got one currently?
- What model have you got?
- How are you finding it?
- Are you looking to upgrade anytime soon?

The UGREEN DXP 4800 Plus impressed me with its hardware capabilities, quiet operation, and flexibility. The ability to run Windows 11 in a VM was genuinely surprising, and the UGOS Pro software is intuitive and feature-rich.

Just remember to set up those SMART tests immediately!

---

## Summary

The UGREEN DXP 4800 Plus is a capable, quiet, and flexible NAS solution that punches above its weight. Whether you're looking for family storage, a home lab platform, or a Synology alternative, it's definitely worth considering.

I hope you enjoyed this review. I shall see you all next time. Bye for now!
