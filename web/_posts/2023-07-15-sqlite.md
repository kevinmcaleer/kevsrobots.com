I'm pleased to annouce a new [Create Databases with Python and SQLite3](/learn/sqlite3/) course is now available for beginners.

It's aimed at beginners (or people teaching beginners), and anyone not familiar with databases or Sqlite.

I'm always interested in feedback so let me know how you find it, and if you would change anything.

Happy programming!
