## Why Adverts in the first place?

![Ad-Free](/assets/img/blog/adfree/adsbanner.jpg){:class="cover"}

Running a website is not free. There are many costs including:

1. Hosting costs (Cost of hardware, bandwidth, and electricity)
1. Annual domain registration fees (I use [GoDaddy.com](https://www.godaddy.com))
1. Email hosting (I use [Microsoft 365](https://www.microsoft365.com))
1. Legal costs (i use [Termly](https://www.termly.io) to provide the privacy policy and terms and conditions)
1. [DDOS](/resources/glossary#ddos) protection and caching (Provided by [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com))
1. Graphics software subscriptions (https://www.canva.com)
1. The time it takes to create content.

I initially added adverts to help cover these costs. However, I found that the adverts were distracting and detracted from the user experience. The ads did generate a reasonable amount of revenue (about half the cost of running the site), but I decided that the user experience was more important.

## Other updates to the site

I've tidied up the main site navigation to move some of the lesser used areas to the [resources](/resources/) section. These include:

* [Glossary](/resources/glossary/)
* [How it Works](/resources/how_it_works/)
* [Events](/events/)
* [Reviews](/reviews/)

I've also added the [Boards](/resources/boards/) section here too.
