[Simon](https://www.x.com/@simonmonk2) is a well known author of many books on electronics and programming. This book is a great introduction to the world of coding and programming. It's aimed at beginners and covers the basics of coding, including how to write your first program, how to use variables, and how to create loops. It also includes a chapter on how to use the Raspberry Pi to learn coding.

Simon is a good friend of mine, and sent me this book for review, as its a topic I'm passionate about and am sure my audience will be interested in too. I've previously bought a number of Simons books including 30 Arduino projects for the evil genius.

## Analysis and Critique

The books strenghts are that it is written with authority, by someone who has a long history in software design and development. Simon has a PhD in Cybernetics and Computer Science from the University of Reading, and has a doctorate in Software Engineering.

The book lays out *how* to learn coding as well as *why* you should learn coding. It's a great introduction to the world of coding and programming, and is suitable for beginners and experts alike.

My only critique of the book is the second section of the book on "Working in Software" is a little short. I would have liked to have seen more information on how to get started in the software industry, and what to expect when you start working in software. I'd also have loved to hear more anecdotes from Simon's career in software.

The books approach is very practical, and it's clear that Simon has a lot of experience in the field. New topics are introduced in an order that makes sense to a beginner, and the subjects are backed up with examples and exercises that help solidify the concepts being discussed.
