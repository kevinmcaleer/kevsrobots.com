## Analysis and Critique

This book is a great introduction to the world of robotics and is suitable for beginners and experts alike. It covers the basics of robotics, including how to build and program a robot, and how to use sensors and actuators. It also includes chapters on how to use the Raspberry Pi Pico to build robots.

The unique aspect of this book is that it focuses on how to build robots with everyday items, keeping the cost low and the complexity down. This is great if you don't happen to own a 3d printer or a laser cutter.

The books is very well written and sufficently covers each topic in depth.
