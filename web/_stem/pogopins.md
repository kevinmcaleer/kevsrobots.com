## What are Pogo Pins?

Pogo pins are spring-loaded contact pins used primarily in electronic test systems and to make connections between modules in electronic devices. They are named for their pogo-stick-like mechanism that allows them to compress and make contact reliably even in high-vibration environments.

---

## Description

Pogo pins are designed with a pin head that can compress into a hollow tube, allowing for consistent electrical contact. They are used extensively in charging docks, test jigs, and in any application where easy, repeatable connection and disconnection are needed.

### Types of Pogo Pins

Pogo Pin Type | Diameter | Spring Force | Current Rating | Typical Use
--------------|----------|--------------|----------------|------------
Standard      | 0.9 mm to 1.5 mm | 60g to 200g  | Up to 3A        | Test jigs, charging stations
High-current  | 2 mm to 3 mm    | 100g to 300g | Up to 10A       | Battery testers, industrial applications
High-density  | 0.5 mm to 0.8 mm| 30g to 100g  | Up to 1A        | Data transfer in compact devices

### Application Areas

**Consumer Electronics**: Common in charging stations and docking ports for wearables and mobile devices.

**Testing and Calibration**: Used in test fixtures for rapidly connecting and disconnecting boards during manufacturing tests.

**Medical Devices**: Employed in equipment that requires frequent disassembly for sterilization and maintenance.

---

## Conventions

Pogo pins are preferred in scenarios where space is limited and high precision is needed. They offer excellent conductivity and durability over many cycles of compression.

---

## Pros and Cons

**Pros**:
- Provide reliable, consistent contact.
- Allow for quick connect and disconnect.
- Suitable for high-density applications where space is at a premium.

**Cons**:
- More expensive than other types of connectors.
- Require precise alignment to ensure good contact.
- Prone to wear and damage if improperly used or subjected to excessive force.
