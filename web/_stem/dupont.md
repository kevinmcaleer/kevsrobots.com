## What are Dupont Connectors?

Dupont connectors are a type of electrical connector commonly used to connect circuit boards, sensors, and other electronics components in a non-permanent way. Known for their versatility, they are widely used in prototyping, educational kits, and DIY electronics.

Dupont connectors are named after the Dupont company, which popularized these connectors in the electronics industry, however they were originally created in 1950 by Berg Electronics.
