## Compute Module 5 Boards Review

Waveshare have released a number of affordable Compute Module 5 boards. These boards are compatible with the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 modules including the eMMC, WiFi enabled as well as `Lite` versions.

## CM5-Nano-A

### Features & Functionality

The CM5 Nano A[^1] is a paired back version of the [CM5-Nano-B](#CM5-Nano-B) board. It has the same form factor but lacks the USB-C port and RTC connector. It is a great option for those who want to use the CM5 in a compact design without the need for additional features.

* 40 pin GPIO Header
* USB A
* USB C Power / flash firmware
* 2x Mipi Display/Camera
* SD Card slot
* RTC connector
* Fan connector
* Power & Boot buttons

### Price

The CM5-Nano-A is priced at $14.99 [^2], making it an affordable option for those looking to use the Compute Module 5 in a compact design.

### Whats in the box

In the box are the CM5-Nano-A board, an optional, unsoldered 40 pin GPIO header.

---

### User instructions & Documentation

The instructions for the board are available on the [Waveshare Wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/CM5-Nano-A). The documentation is clear and easy to follow, though I did get a little confused about how to flash the eMMC so that the Raspberry Pi can boot from the internal storage.

---

### Ease of use

The boards could not be simpler to use, just plug in the CM5 module and you're away. If you want to use the optional GPIO headers, there is a small bit of soldering required.

---

### Availability

Available world wide; check out the list of resellers on Waveshares website <https://www.waveshare.com>.

---

### Asthetics

The boards are straightforward and functional. There isn't much space to waste in this form factor, and the components are thoguthfully laid out.

---

### Build Quality

The PCBs and components have a solid connection and the overall board seems pretty robust.

---

### Packaging

The packaging was simple and functional. The boards were well protected in the box and there was no damage to the boards during shipping.

For extra points the plastic bubble wrap could be replaced with shredded cardboard or paper.

---

### Environmental

The packaging could be made a little more environmentally friendly by using shredded cardboard or paper instead of plastic bubble wrap. 

---

## Summary

Overall, if you're looking for a low cost, no-frills Compute Module then is a solid choice.
