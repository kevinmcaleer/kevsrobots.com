## Inventor 2040 W

The Inventor 2040 W is the new board from Pimoroni. It has a host of features and connector making it easy to turn your ideas into real world contraptions.


### Features

Here are a list of the features:

* Raspberry Pi Pico W Aboard
    * Powered and programmable by USB micro-B
    * 2.4GHz wireless
* 2 JST-SH connectors (6 pin) for attaching motors
    * Dual H-Bridge motor driver (DRV8833)
    * Per motor current limiting (0.5A)
    * Per motor direction indicator LEDs
* 2 pin (Picoblade-compatible) connector for attaching speaker
* JST-PH (2 pin) connector for attaching battery (input voltage 2.5V - 5.5V*)
* 6 sets of header pins for connecting 3 pin hobby servos
* 6 sets of header pins for GPIO (3 of which are ADC capable)
* 12 x addressable RGB LEDs/Neopixels
* User button
* Reset button (built in Captain Resetti!)
* 2 x Qw/ST connectors for attaching breakouts
* Unpopulated headers for adding a Breakout Garden slot
* Fully assembled
* No soldering required (unless you want to add the Breakout Garden slot).

## Perfect for robotics projects

This board was designed with the robot maker in mind, with 6 servo header pins, 2 motors connectors and a bunch of RGB LEDs for indicating status or just to make some cool lighting effects. The 2 QW/ST connectors mean its really easy to add additional sensors, and the Breakout Garden header at the front of the board makes it simple to add a laser range finder to the front to enable your robot to detect objects.

The board also has a JST-PH connector for attaching a battery, such as the Galleon battery, or any other battery pack with this common connector type.

## Pros

* Great for getting started with robotics
* One board that has everything you need
* Great price for the functionality
* Documentation is excellent, with examples

---

## Cons

* 2 motors may not be enough connectors for some projects
* The motor connectors are proprietary, a screw terminal option would have been nice too
* Requires the Pimoroni branded MicroPython build to access the boards features
