## Elecfreaks microbit Retro Arcade Review

The Elecfreaks Retro:Game Arcade Kit is an exciting and interactive educational kit designed to help you explore programming and electronics while having fun with classic arcade games. This kit offers hands-on experience and the satisfaction of building your own mini arcade console.

---

### Features & Functionality

The core of the Retro:Game Arcade Kit is the micro:bit, a compact, powerful microcontroller designed for education. The Arcade Kit features a joystick for controlling game elements and two push buttons to act as function buttons.

The Arcade Kit includes an RGB LED strip for a colorful light show, an OLED screen to display the games, a buzzer for generating sound effects, and a vibration motor for haptic feedback.

### Whats in the box

The box also doubles as a neat carrycase, which contains:

* Retro Arcade Shield
* Acrylic Top Cover
* Acrylic Bottom Cover
* screws
* screwdriver
* Instructions

---

#### User instructions & Documentation

The Retro:Game Arcade Kit provides a wealth of possibilities for creative projects. Users can design their own arcade games, ranging from simple classics like Snake or Pong to more complex projects like a mini-version of Space Invaders or a maze navigation game. 

The included hardware can be used to add extra features to your games - for instance, the RGB LED strip can be programmed to change color based on game events, and the vibration motor can provide feedback to the player.

---

### Ease of use

The kit is easy to assembly, though the button covers do require quite a lot of force to push into place; more than you'd think.

The micro:bit simply pushes into place at the top of the handheld, with the LED matrix facing forwards.

Simple, transparent design, with nice rounded corners, comfortable to hold for an extended period of time.

No informaiton was available about the sourcing, manufacturing, distribution or disposal.
