## Elecfreaks microbit Retro Arcade Review

The Elecfreaks Retro:Game Arcade Kit is an exciting and interactive educational kit designed to help you explore programming and electronics while having fun with classic arcade games. This kit offers hands-on experience and the satisfaction of building your own mini arcade console.

---

### Features & Functionality

The core of the Retro:Game Arcade Kit is the micro:bit, a compact, powerful microcontroller designed for education. The Arcade Kit features a joystick for controlling game elements and two push buttons to act as function buttons.

The Arcade Kit includes an RGB LED strip for a colorful light show, an OLED screen to display the games, a buzzer for generating sound effects, and a vibration motor for haptic feedback.

### Whats in the box

The box also doubles as a neat carrycase, which contains:

* Retro Arcade Shield
* Acrylic Top Cover
* Acrylic Bottom Cover
* screws
* screwdriver
* Instructions

#### User instructions & Documentation

The Retro:Game Arcade Kit provides a wealth of possibilities for creative projects. Users can design their own arcade games, ranging from simple classics like Snake or Pong to more complex projects like a mini-version of Space Invaders or a maze navigation game. 

The included hardware can be used to add extra features to your games - for instance, the RGB LED strip can be programmed to change color based on game events, and the vibration motor can provide feedback to the player.

---

### Ease of use

The kit is easy to assembly, though the button covers do require quite a lot of force to push into place; more than you'd think.

The micro:bit simply pushes into place at the top of the handheld, with the LED matrix facing forwards.
