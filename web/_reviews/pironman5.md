## The Best Case for Raspberry Pi 5?

The **official** Raspberry Pi 5 case is great but becomes problematic if you want to add an NVMe drive and have it protected by the case enclosure. Pi 5s with an NVMe drive can also get quite hot.

Enter the Pironman 5 case from [Sunfounder](https://www.sunfounder.com); it is a great alternative, with a built-in NVMe slot and a large cooling fan to keep everything running smoothly. It has an aluminum case with see-through acrylic side plates and looks fantastic. The RGB lighting adds a nice touch.

---

## Standard HDMI Ports

One of the nice features of this case is the two standard-size HDMI ports, which make it easy to connect to a monitor or TV without needing an adapter or special cables.

---

## NVMe Slot Included

The NVMe slot is a great addition, and the case comes with all the screws and standoffs needed to install an NVMe drive. Be sure to check the compatibility list for supported drives, as not all drives are supported.

---

## Front Accessible SD Card Slot

The front of the case has a slot for the SD card, making it easy to swap out the card without taking the case apart or flipping it over. The SD card slot is spring-loaded, so the card pops out when pressed.

---

## OLED Display

The OLED display is a nice touch, displaying useful information such as CPU and RAM usage, temperature, and IP address. The display is bright and easy to read and can be turned off if needed.

---

#### User Instructions & Documentation

[![Pironman assembly instructions](/assets/reviews/pironman5_instructions.png){:class="img-fluid w-50 rounded-lg shadow-lg"}](https://pironman5.rtfd.io)

The assembly is fun and takes around an hour to complete. The instructions are clear and easy to follow, and the case is well-designed and easy to put together.

The only issue I had was attaching the fans; the screws did not want to grip the fans, and I had to use alternative screws.

---

### Ease of Use

Once assembled, the case is a delight to use, with the large front-facing button, easily accessible GPIO pins, and front-facing SD card slot.

The only ease-of-use issue is with the CSI camera and DSI display connectors - they are obscured by the NVMe drive expansion board; this case isn't really designed for use with cameras or displays other than HDMI.

---

### Availability

The Pironman 5 case is available from [Sunfounder](https://www.sunfounder.com) for $79.99 and ships worldwide.

---

### Aesthetics

The aluminum case, see-through side panels, and RGB lighting make this case look fantastic.

---

### Price

At $79.99, compared to the Geeek Pi mini tower case, the Pironman 5 is more expensive, but the additional features and build quality make it worth the extra cost.

---

### Build Quality

The case is very robust and solid, with nicely finished aluminum and no sharp corners. The acrylic side panels are thick and well-made, and the case feels like it will last a long time. The foam feet also provide some soundproofing, though it runs very quietly anyway.

---

### Packaging

The packaging is good, with all the parts well protected and easy to find. The box is sturdy and well-designed, and the instructions are clear and easy to follow.

---

### Environmental

There were lots of little plastic bags inside the box, which could have been replaced with paper envelopes for a better environmental score. The case itself is made from aluminum, which is recyclable.

---

## Summary

Overall, the Pironman 5 case is a great case for the Raspberry Pi 5, with a lot of features and a great design. The case is well-built and easy to assemble, and the additional features such as the NVMe slot, OLED display, and RGB lighting make it a great choice for anyone looking for a high-quality case for their Raspberry Pi 5.
