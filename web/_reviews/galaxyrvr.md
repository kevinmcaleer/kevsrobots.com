### User instructions & Documentation

The kit includes easy to understand instructions with clear diagrams and explanations. There is also a comprehensive online resource with tutorials and example code to help you get started with programming the GalaxyRVR. Videos are also provided to help with assembly and setup.

---

### Ease of use

Assembling the robot is a couple of hours of fun, and easy to do with the provided instructions and tools. The programming is done using the Arduino IDE, and the SunFounder website provides example code to get you started.

I did have some issues with the wifi connectivity - As this is used to connect to the SmartPhone App, I wasn't able to test this aspect of the robot.

---

### Availability

The GalaxyRVR is available from the [SunFounder website](https://www.sunfounder.com/collections/arduino-diy-robot/products/sunfounder-galaxyrvr-mars-rover-kit) and from Amazon for around $129.99.

---

### Asthetics

The robot looks great, with the underlighting and camera giving it a futuristic look. The aluminum chassis is sturdy and well made. The unusual wheel design is a nice touch too, making it look like a Mars rover and able to traverse rough terrain.

---

### Price

$129.99, which includes the Arduino Uno R3, the GalaxyRVR shield, and a wide range of sensors and motors, is a great price & value for a robot kit of this quality.

---

### Build Quality

The overall build quality is excellent with a mixure of aluminum and plastic parts. The motors are strong and the wheels are well made (though I did have to replace one of the parts with a 3d printed replacement as it had the wrong hole in it for the wheel; I contacted SunFounder about this). The electronics are well made and the custom PCB and connectors make it easy to assemble.

---

### Packaging

The box and internal boxes are all made from recyclble cardboard, however there are a lot of different types of plastic bags containing the various sizes of screws and components.

---

### Environmental

The solar panel is a nice touch, and the inclusion of a lipo battery is a great addition. The robot is designed to be used outdoors, and the solar panel can be used to recharge the battery.
