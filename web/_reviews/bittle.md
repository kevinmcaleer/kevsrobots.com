## üëç Recommendation

A great, if not slightly expensive, STEM robot dog for learning and playing. The [Review Score](#review-score) is only really let down by the excess packaging; otherwise, this is a solid buy decision.

## Bittle Review

Meet Bittle, the Palm-sized Open Source Quadruped Robot Dog. It has impressive performance for such a tiny package. Moreover, it is highly programmable with the lifelike animal behaviours of a four-legged robot. Bittle is the evolution of the OpenCat project, initially developed by Petoi founder Rongzhong Li.

![Bittle and Opencat](/assets/img/reviews/bittle_opencat.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-25"}

It's aimed at adults or children under supervision (14+), so this is quite like the Lego Brainstorm kits that were available up until recently.

Part of the fun with this is in constructing the robot and then learning how to program it and extend its behaviours.

#### User instructions & Documentation

The instructions are available via the Petoi website and can be updated long after the product is shipped. The documentation is available in a couple of languages too.

---

### Ease of use

Bittle is suitable for adults and children over the age of 14. Kids can enjoy playing with Bittle under the supervision of an adult.

---

### Availability

Bittle is widely available (worldwide); the Developer model was unavailable for purchase as of the time of this writing.

---

### Aesthetics

The design of Bittle is a clear evolution and improvement on the original Opencat robot. The parts are sculpted, moulded plastic and fit together perfectly, and the proportions are pleasing to the eye. The colour combinations work well together and complement each other. The tail is a particularly nice touch.

---

### Price

The price for the preassembled robot is $248.99, and $231.99 for the construction-only version. There is also a Developer version for $368.99 USD[^2].

[^2]: Prices correct as of February 2023

Version      |   Price
-------------|-------:
Preassembled | $248.99
Construction | $231.99
Developer    | $368.99

#### Colours

Bittle is available in 3 colour combinations:

* Black, Yellow and blue
* Black, Yellow
* Black

---

### Build Quality

The build quality is excellent, the parts snap together nicely with a very close fit, and the overall fit and finish are high quality.

The springs on the foot mechanisms are excellent and give the feet some bounce and responsiveness.

---

### Packaging

One thing of note about this product is that this is a lot of largely unnecessary plastic packaging. Plastic packaging will likely hold all the parts in place during shipping; however, other companies have found ways to do this with cardboard rather than plastic.

---

### Environmental

I checked the website and tried looking for a statement about the environment design, production, packaging, delivery or disposal of the product. There was no environmental policy or clean energy use that I could find.
