The Space Science Kit is a new micro:bit robot kit from Elecfreaks. It's a great STEM robot kit for young scientists, with plenty of sensors to take readings from. It's very easy to connect the sensors, and it leverages Microsoft Makecode for easy programming. The kit has a nice design and good quality parts, with a good selection of sensors, motors and a display.

## Cons

- Instructions a little bit confusing - the length of the axels was not clear
- Some of the part colours were different than the instructions
- The instructions didn't show the best way to wire up the motors and sensors
- There were 4 short and 4 long cables provided, but the robot has 9 motors and sensors, so it was a bit confusing
- 2 wheels were missing
- Charging the battery isnt explained
- Connecting up the sensors was tricky due to the placement
- The bags were numbered, but the instructions didn't build in the order of the bags
- Its as if the kit was desigend by someone who hasn't played with Lego before
