## Elecfreaks XGO CM4 Robot Kit for Raspberry Pi

The Elecfreaks XGO robotic dog kit for the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 4 is amazing to see in real life. Its has an all metal construction making it solid and robust, and it looks amazing - the fit and finish is clearly very polished and high quality.

### Features & Functionality

The robot has 4 legs, each with 3 degrees of freedom, and also a robotic arm on top that also has 3 degrees of freedom. This means the robot has 15 degrees of freedom, which is pretty impressive.

Another impressive feature of this robot is the inclusion of a Raspberry Pi Compute module 4; this enables the robot to do some incredible on device AI and machine learning feats. Paired with the onboard camera and display, this makes the robot engaging, fun and very adaptable.

The robot comes with a charger, which has a well designed and thoughtfully placed charge connector on the robot to charge the onboard LiPo battery up before use. The charger has an indicator light that is red during charing and green once its complete.

### Ease of use

The robot kit comes fully assembled, all you need to do is press the button on the top to switch it on. The robot will then stand up, stretch its arm and then retract the arm. By this time the front screen will have booted up (the robot has two independent controllers in it).

### Asthetics

The robot is all metal and has a great finish to it. It looks like a smaller version of the Boston Dynamics Spot robot, particularly with the arm on the back.
