## Recommendation 👍👍👍

This is a good Kit for young scientists, with lots of sensors to include in projects. Its thoughfully put together and the storage box is a nice touch. However there are some issues with the instructions and the build process that could be improved.

At $229.00 the kit is on the expensive side.

## Overview

The `Space Science Kit` is a new micro:bit robot kit from [Elecfreaks](https://www.elecfreaks.com). It's a great STEM robot kit for young scientists, with plenty of sensors to take readings from. It's very easy to connect the sensors, and it leverages Microsoft Makecode for quick and straight forward programming. The kit has a nice design and good quality parts, with a good selection of sensors, motors and a display.

The kit comes in a large plastic tub which is great for holding the parts and spares once the model is created.

## Assembly

Takes around 2 hours to build the kit, there is a paper instruction manual included in the box which covers the Nezha breakout board v2 that is used to connect the electronics to the microbit (not included). The model build instructions can be found at: <https://wiki.elecfreaks.com/en/micro-bit-space-science-kit>.

The kit is similar to a Lego Technics kit and does not require any special tools.

## Microsoft Makecode & Microbit Python Programming Languages

The kit can be programmed using Microsoft Makecode or Microbit Python. The Makecode blocks are easy to use and the kit comes with a number of example programs to get you started.

## Pros

* A great STEM robot kit for young scientists
* Plenty of sensors to take readings from
* Very easy to connect the sensors
* Leverages Microsoft Makecode for easy programming
* Nice design, good use of colour and section of parts
* Good quality parts
* Good selection of sensors, motors and a display

---

## Cons

* Instructions a little bit confusing - the length of the axels was not clear (which meant I had to undo previously built parts)
* Some of the part colours were different than the instructions
* The instructions didn't show the best way to wire up the motors and sensors
* There were 4 short and 4 long cables provided, but the robot has 9 motors and sensors, so it was a bit confusing
* 2 wheels were missing from the kit, which was disappointing
* Connecting up the sensors was tricky due to the placement, this could have been better designed to be included during contruction rather than once the model was built
* The bags were numbered, but the instructions didn't build in the order of the bags
* On the box there are two little Minifig like characters, but they are not included in the kit
* Expensive at $229.00
* To upload code the microbit needs to be removed from the robot in some models due to the placement of other parts
