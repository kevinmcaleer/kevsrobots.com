## üëç Recommendation

This is a solid buy recommendation, This is a perfect starter kit for getting into robotics, and learning how to programme. if you already have a micro:bit you can use that instead of the Pico:ed.

## Elecfreak Cutebot Review
[Cutebot](https://www.elecfreaks.com/elecfreaks-pico-ed-smart-cutebot-kit-with-pico-ed-board.html) is a small programmable robot, based on the Pico:Ed or Micro:bit microcontroller. It can be programmed in MicroPython, [Microblocks](http://www.microblocks.fun/) and C++.


[![Cutebot on a desk](/assets/img/reviews/cutebot02.jpg){:class="img-fluid w-100"}](/assets/img/reviews/cutebot02.jpg)

### Features
Cutebot has the following features:

* Dual line following sensors
* 2 motors
* 2 RGB LED user programmable 'headlights'
* IR sensor
* Ultrasonic rangefinder for avoiding obstacles or following them!
* Ambient Chassis lights
* Headers for expansion and access to the I2C bus and GPIOs
* Battery box for 3 AAA batteries

---

### Whats in the box

The Cutebot kit contains everything you need to get started (apart from 3 AAA batteries). The box contains:

* The Cutebot robot
* A MicroUSB cable for programming the robot
* An AAA battery box and sticky pad for attaching it to the robot
* An ultrasonic range finder for measuring distance and detecting objects in front of the robot
* A Pico:ed microcontroller board for controlling the robot
* User Instructions
* A line following sheet; the robot can follow the black line drawn on the sheet

#### User instructions

The guide that comes with the kit has a couple of easy examples (they call then cases, as in use-cases) to get you started:

* Case 01: Move Forward or Reverse at the Full Speed
* Case 02: Speed Up Gradually
* Case 03: Dance in Figure-of-eight
* Case 04: Run at Random
* Case 05: Automatic Headlights
* Case 06: Steering&Clearance Lamps
* Case 07: Fall-arrest Cutebot
* Case 08: Run Along the Black Line
* Case 09: Autonomous Obstacle Avoidance
* Case 10: Car Following with A Fixed Distance
* Case 11: micro:bit Remote Control
* Case 12: Remote Control the Cutebot with micro:bit Accelerometer
* Case 13: Remote Control with Joystick:bit
* Case 14: IR Remote Control Car
* Case 15: Seeking the Light

### Programming languages

The Pico:ed (and therefore cutebot), can be programmed using a couple of different approaches:

#### Microblocks
[Microblocks](http://www.microblocks.fun/) is a Scratch-like, visual programming environment suited to beginners, particularly young people in education.

#### MicroPython
[Micro:bit Makemode](https://makecode.microbit.org) provides an web-based environment for coding in MicroPython.

#### Javascript
[Micro:bit Makemode - Javascript mode](https://makecode.microbit.org) also enables you to program the Pico:ed in Javascript, simply by toggling he slider over from Python to Javascript.

#### C++
For the more experienced and hardcore programmer, the Pico:ed can be programmed in C++. The main benefit of this is the speed of execution of code, and the smaller code size on board. The main disadvantage is that C++ can be quite complicated and intimidating for beginners, and requires experience and knowledge to do the most basic of things.

---

### Price

The price for the Cutebot:

* ***with*** the pico:ed - $47.90
* ***without*** the pico:ed - $34.90

### Pico:ed

The Pico:ed is a microcontroller, similiar in form factor to the BBC Micro:Bit. Unlike the Micro:Bit, the Pico:Ed has a Raspberry Pi RP2040 as the main processor, bringing all the rich features and software support for that chip.

The pico:ed is priced around $12.90.

## Pros 
* Small, solid construction
* Very easy to setup and start programming
* Lots of features for the price
* Price
* Compatibility - Accessories & Plugins available
* Expandability - easy to add lego to it

## Cons
* I had a few problem getting the software to work initially (CircuitPython libraries)
