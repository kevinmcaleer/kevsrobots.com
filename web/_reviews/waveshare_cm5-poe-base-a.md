## Compute Module 5 Boards Review

Waveshare have released a number of affordable Compute Module 5 boards. These boards are compatible with the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 modules including the eMMC, WiFi enabled as well as `Lite` versions.

---

### Features & Functionality

The CM5 Nano A[^1] is a paired back version of the [CM5-Nano-B](#CM5-Nano-B) board. It has the same form factor but lacks the USB-C port and RTC connector. It is a great option for those who want to use the CM5 in a compact design without the need for additional features.

It has the same form factor as the Raspberry IO Dev board.

The Built-in NMVe is a nice touch. The 2x Fullsize HDMI is better than the 2x Micro HDMI connectors on the regular Raspberry Pi. Built-in RTC Clock battery socket is also a welcome addition. The Power over Ethernet (PoE) is the main feature of this board, meaning you can power if from the Ethernet cable, as long as the switch it is connected to has PoE enabled.

* 40 pin GPIO Header
* 4x USB A
* Ethernet socket with PoE
* 2x HDMI
* USB C Power / flash firmware
* 2x MiPi Display/Camera
* SD Card slot
* RTC Battery socket
* Fan connector
* NVMe Socket
* Power & Boot buttons

### Price

The CM5-PoE-BASE-A is priced at $31.99 [^2] for the version without PoE and $44.99 with PoE. , making it an affordable option for those looking to use the Compute Module 5 in a compact design.

### Whats in the box

In the box are the CM5-PoE-BASE-A board.

---

### User instructions & Documentation

The instructions for the board are available on the [Waveshare Wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/CM5-Nano-A). The documentation is clear and easy to follow, though I did get a little confused about how to flash the eMMC so that the Raspberry Pi can boot from the internal storage.

---

### Ease of use

The boards could not be simpler to use, just plug in the CM5 module and you're away.

---

### Availability

Available world wide; check out the list of resellers on Waveshares website <https://www.waveshare.com>.

---

### Asthetics

Dev boards are straightforward and functional, these are designed to test our features for smaller boards so tend to be large and have lots of space around the components. They aren't going to win a beauty competition.

---

### Build Quality

The PCBs and components have a solid connection and the overall board seems pretty robust.

---

### Packaging

The packaging was simple and functional. The boards were well protected in the box and there was no damage to the boards during shipping.

For extra points the plastic bubble wrap could be replaced with shredded cardboard or paper.

---

### Environmental

The packaging could be made a little more environmentally friendly by using shredded cardboard or paper instead of plastic bubble wrap. 

---

## Summary


Overall, if you're looking for an affordable development board to the Raspberry Pi 5 Compute Module then is a solid choice.
