## üëç Recommendation

This is very much a buy recommendation. If you can afford it, go for the 4Gb or 8Gb version. Also don't cheap out on the SD Card; buy a quality memory card such as Sandisk.

## Raspberry Pi 4b 2Gb Review

The Raspberry Pi 4 is the flagship board from Raspberry Pi and the latest incarnation of the small credit card sized single board computer.

It features a Broadcom BCM2711, Quad core Cortex-A72 (ARM v8) 64-bit SoC @ 1.5GHz

## Features

### USB 3
The Raspberry Pi 4 has 4 USB A ports - two USB v2 and two USB v3 ports. These provide connectivity to a keyboard and mouse (and I'd recommend the official Keyboard and mouse from Raspberry Pi too).

Your new Raspberry Pi 4 has upgraded USB capacity: along with two USB 2 ports you'll find two USB 3 ports, which can transfer data up to ten times faster.


### Fast networking

Raspberry Pi 4 comes with Gigabit Ethernet, along with onboard wireless networking and Bluetooth.

1Gb Ethernet is provided by the RJ45 connector next to the USB ports. This is plenty fast enough for everything the Pi is capable of. I recommend using the wired connection where possible, as its the most reliable and fastest way to connect your Pi to a network.

### Wi-Fi & Bluetooth

2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz IEEE 802.11ac wireless, Bluetooth 5.0, BLE
Gigabit Ethernet

### Display ports

2 Micro-HDMI Display ports
Supports 2x 4K displays

### Silent, energy-efficient

The fanless, energy-efficient Raspberry Pi runs silently and uses far less power than other computers.

### GPIO Header

Raspberry Pi standard 40 pin GPIO header (fully backwards compatible with previous boards)

### DSI & CSI Ports

2-lane MIPI DSI display port
2-lane MIPI CSI camera port

### Audio

4-pole stereo audio and composite video port
