## Wukong 2040 by Elecfreaks

The [`ELECFREAKS Wukong2040 Breakout Board For Raspberry Pi Pico`](https://shop.elecfreaks.com/products/elecfreaks-wukong2040-expansion-board-adapter-for-raspberry-pi-pico){:class="dotted"} is a Raspberry Pi Pico expansion board, aimed at education, and hobbyists.

The Pico or Pico W (not included) simply slots into the header socket on the board and can be powered by the onboard 18650, or by the Pico's Micro-B USB connector.

The board is very reasonably priced at $9.99, much cheaper than other Pico expansion boards that have less functionality. This makes it very accessible and affordable for the education and hobbyist market.

### Unique features

The board has 2 unique features - the [`18650`](/resources/glossary#18650) battery holder and the Lego compatible base.

---

### 18650 LiPo battery power

The 18650 brings more than enough power to keep your projects going without being tethered to a computer or power supply, and the onboard charging means you dont need any additional plugs to chargers the battery up.

---

### 12 Servos

The 12 servos headers provide plenty of capability for a spider robot, or projects that require many servo headers.

---

### 4 Motors

The board also features 4 motor headers, which is an improvement over many other boards that only offer 2 headers.
4 Motor headers means we can add 4 wheel drive, which is essential for Mecanum wheeled robots.

---

### Buzzer

The Buzzer can make simple beeps, or if you add a bit more code, you can play simple melodies. This brings a lot of extra fun to any robot project!

---

### 2 User buttons

The board has two user buttons, each placed next to an RGB LED light. These are competely user programmable, and means you can add onboard controls to your robot. 

---

### RGB LED lights

Another clever addition to the board are the two RGB LEDs, which are actually an RGB LED Strip, which only requires one data pin to control. RGB Lights are both fun and practical as they add the ability to add status indicators, as well as some sparkle to any project.
