## Compute Module 5 Boards Review

Waveshare have released a number of affordable Compute Module 5 boards. These boards are compatible with the Raspberry Pi Compute Module 5 modules including the eMMC, WiFi enabled as well as `Lite` versions.

### Features & Functionality

* 40 pin GPIO Header
* 2x USB A
* 1x HDMI
* Ethernet socket
* USB C Power / flash firmware
* 2x MiPi Display/Camera
* SD Card slot
* RTC Battery socket
* Fan connector
* NVMe Socket
* Power & Boot buttons
* Raspberry Pi 5 form factor

The full-size HDMI port is a great addition to the board, allowing for easy connection to displays though its in on a different side of the board and does take up the space where the regular 2x USB ports are located on the Raspberry Pi. I think the trade off of a single, full size HDMI Port, instead of two micro-HDMI ports is fair.

The PCIe slot is also a great feature, allowing for expansion options.

---

The CM5-IO_BASE_B is priced at $23.99 [^2], making it an affordable option for those looking to use the Compute Module 5 in a compact design.

### User instructions & Documentation

The instructions for the board are available on the [Waveshare Wiki](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/CM5-IO-BASE-B). The documentation is clear and easy to follow, though I did get a little confused about how to flash the eMMC so that the Raspberry Pi can boot from the internal storage.

---

### Ease of use

The boards could not be simpler to use, just plug in the CM5 module and you're away.

### Asthetics

The boards looks similar to a Raspberry Pi 5, and is straightforward and functional. The ports are thoughfully laid out, though there are changes from the standard Raspberry Pi, such as the single, full-size HDMI port.

---

### Build Quality

The PCBs and components have a solid connection and the overall board seems pretty robust.

---

### Packaging

The packaging was simple and functional. The boards were well protected in the box and there was no damage to the boards during shipping.

For extra points the plastic bubble wrap could be replaced with shredded cardboard or paper.

---

### Environmental

The packaging could be made a little more environmentally friendly by using shredded cardboard or paper instead of plastic bubble wrap. 

---

## Summary

Overall, if you're looking for a low cost, fully featured Compute Module in the Raspberry Pi 5 form-factor then is a solid choice.
