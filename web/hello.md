# Markdown is Awesome

Notice the heading 1 style above was made by simply including the `#` key.

## Code
You can wrap code in three ` characters, the result looks like this:
``` python
def hello():
    print('Hello World')
    return 1
```
---

## Style
Three dashes makes a horizontal line.

*Italic*
**bold**
***Italic Bold***
~~Strikethrough~~

## Lists
You can also make lists using the - or * characters:
- item 1
- item 2
* item 1
* item 2

You can also make numbers lists:
1. item 1
1. item 2
1. item 3

Notice how we only used `1.` and the Markdown interpreter enumerates the list.

Embed links using the `<` and `>` characters:

You can also hide links using `[]()`:
[This is a link](http://www.clustered-pi.com)

Images can be embedded using `![]()`:
