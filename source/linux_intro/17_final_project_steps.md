## Introduction

Now that you’ve planned your project, it’s time to start coding! This lesson will guide you through the steps of creating, testing, and finalizing your command-line tool.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Write and test your command-line tool.
- Debug and refine your script.
- Finalize and document your project.

---

### Writing Your Script

Using your project plan, start coding your script. Focus on getting the basic functionality working first. Use the skills you’ve learned throughout this course, such as:

- File management (`cp`, `mv`, `rsync`).
- Process management (`ps`, `kill`).
- Networking (`ssh`, `scp`).
- Scripting constructs (variables, loops, conditionals).

---

### Testing and Debugging

After writing your script, test it thoroughly:

1. **Test in different scenarios**: Ensure your script works as expected in various conditions.
1. **Check for errors**: Use `echo` to print variables and messages at different points in the script to help debug issues.
1. **Handle edge cases**: Consider what might go wrong and how your script should handle such situations.

---

### Finalizing Your Project

Once your script is working, finalize it by:

1. **Adding comments**: Explain what each part of your script does to make it easier to understand.
1. **Documenting usage**: Create a `README.md` file that explains how to use your tool.
1. **Testing again**: Run final tests to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Summary

In this lesson, you wrote, tested, and finalized your command-line tool. Congratulations on completing your final project! This project is a testament to the skills you’ve learned in this course.
