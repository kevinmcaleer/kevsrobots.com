## Introduction

As a culmination of this course, you will create a simple command-line tool that incorporates the skills you've learned. This lesson will help you plan and outline your project.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the scope and requirements of the final project.
- Plan the structure and functionality of your command-line tool.
- Identify the Linux commands and scripting techniques you will use.

---

### Project Overview

The final project involves creating a command-line tool that performs a useful task, such as backing up files, automating a system process, or monitoring system performance.

---

### Project Planning

Before you start coding, plan your project by answering these questions:

1. **What is the purpose of your tool?**
1. **Which commands will your tool use?**
1. **Will your tool require user input?**
1. **How will you test your tool?**

Write down the answers and outline the structure of your script.

### Example Project: Backup Script

For example, you could create a script that backs up a directory to a specified location and logs the operation:

1. Use `rsync` to copy files.
1. Use a loop to iterate over multiple directories.
1. Log the results to a file with `echo`.

## Summary

In this lesson, you planned and outlined your final project. Taking the time to plan your script will make the coding process smoother and help you create a more functional and efficient tool.
