### Initializing a Git Repository

To start tracking a project with Git, navigate to the project directory and initialize a repository:

git init
```

## Adding and Committing Changes

After making changes to your files, you need to add them to the staging area and commit them:

git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"

The add command stages your changes, and commit saves them to the repository with a descriptive message.

        git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git

This command downloads the project and its entire history to your local machine.
