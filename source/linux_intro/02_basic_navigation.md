## Introduction

Navigating the filesystem is a fundamental skill when working with the command line. In this lesson, you'll learn how to use basic commands to find your way around the Raspberry Pi OS filesystem.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the structure of the Raspberry Pi OS filesystem.
- Learn how to use the `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `clear` and `history` commands.
- Differentiate between absolute and relative paths.

---

### Understanding the Filesystem Structure

The Linux filesystem is organized in a hierarchical structure, starting from the root directory (`/`). Every file and directory is nested within this structure. Here's a basic overview:

- `/` : Root directory, the top level of the filesystem.
- `/home` : Contains user directories, like `/home/pi` for the Raspberry Pi user.
- `/etc` : Configuration files for the system.
- `/var` : Variable data, such as logs and temporary files.
- `/usr` : User programs and data.
- `/bin` : Essential system binaries.
- `/lib` : Shared libraries.
- `/opt` : Optional software packages.
- `/tmp` : Temporary files.

### The `pwd` Command

The `pwd` (print working directory) command displays the current directory you are in. This is useful to know where you are in the filesystem.

```bash
pwd
```

![pwd command](/learn/linux_intro/assets/pwd.png){:class="w-100 img-fluid card-hover card-shadow rounded-3"}

---

## The `ls` Command

The `ls` (list) command lists the contents of a directory. You can use it to see files and subdirectories within your current directory.

``` bash
ls
```

![ls command](/learn/linux_intro/assets/ls.png){:class="w-100 img-fluid card-hover card-shadow rounded-3"}

You can also use options with ls to get more detailed information:

```bash
ls -l
```

![ls -l command](/learn/linux_intro/assets/ls-l.png){:class="w-100 img-fluid card-hover card-shadow rounded-3"}

---

## The `cd` Command

The `cd` (change directory) command allows you to navigate between directories. For example, to move into the `Documents` directory, you would type:

```bash
cd Documents
```

![cd command](/learn/linux_intro/assets/cd.png){:class="w-100 img-fluid card-hover card-shadow rounded-3"}

To return to the home directory, simply type:

```bash
cd $HOME
```

![cdhome command](/learn/linux_intro/assets/cdhome.png){:class="w-100 img-fluid card-hover card-shadow rounded-3"}

To back up one directory, use:

```bash
cd ..
```

![cd  .. command](/learn/linux_intro/assets/cddotdot.png){:class="w-100 img-fluid card-hover card-shadow rounded-3"}

---

## Absolute vs. Relative Paths

- **Absolute Path:** A path that starts from the root directory `/`, e.g., `/home/pi/Documents`.
- **Relative Path:** A path relative to the current directory, e.g., `Documents` if you are in `/home/pi`.

---

## Clearing the console

To clear the terminal screen, you can use the `clear` command:

        clear

This will clear the terminal screen, making it easier to read the output of new commands.

---

## History Command

The `history` command is a useful tool that shows you a list of the commands youâ€™ve previously run in the terminal. This can help you remember commands you've used before or quickly repeat them without typing them out again.

To see your command history, simply type:

```bash
history
```

This will display a numbered list of your recent commands.

### Re-running Previous Commands

You can easily re-run a command from your history by using the `!` symbol followed by the command number. For example, if the command you want to repeat is number 42 in the history list, you can type:

```bash
!42
```

This will execute the command exactly as you ran it before.

### Using History for Efficiency

- **Repeating the Last Command**: If you want to run the very last command again, you can use `!!`:

  ```bash
  !!
  ```

  This is handy if you forgot to use `sudo` and want to rerun the command with it.

- **Searching Your History**: You can search for a previous command by typing `Ctrl + r` and then start typing part of the command. This will show you the most recent match from your history, which you can then execute by pressing `Enter`.

---

## Summary

In this lesson, you learned how to navigate the filesystem using the `pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `clear` and `history` commands, and you now understand the difference between absolute and relative paths. These are essential skills for working efficiently in the command line.
