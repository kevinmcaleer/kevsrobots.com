There are a couple of basic parts to build your SMARS:

### 3D Printed Parts

It makes sense to print the parts in roughtly the order you are going to construct it in:

1. [The chassis](/assets/stl/smars/chassis.stl)
1. [The powered wheels x2](/assets/stl/smars/powered_wheel.stl)
1. [The unpowered wheels x2](/assets/stl/smars/unpowered_wheel.stl)
1. [The mechanical tracks x32](/assets/stl/smars/tracks.stl)
1. [The holding board (for the 9v battery)](/assets/stl/smars/motor_holder.stl)
1. [The range finder holder](/assets/stl/smars/range_finder_holder.stl)
1. [The range finder cover](/assets/stl/smars/range_finder_cover.stl)
