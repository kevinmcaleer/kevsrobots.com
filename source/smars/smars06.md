## Attach Wheels

There are two types of wheel - `Powered` and `Unpowered`. The powered wheels are driven by the motors, whereas the unpowered wheels are free spinning. The unpowered wheels push onto the lugs on the chassis (a little bit of force is required). It is also a good idea to make sure the lugs and the unpowered wheels dont have any rough edges so that they can turn without effort.
