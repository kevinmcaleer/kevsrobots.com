🎉 Congratulations — you’ve completed your first C programming course on the Raspberry Pi Pico!

You’ve gone from absolute beginner to writing real C programs that interact with **hardware**. That’s a huge leap — well done!

---

## What You’ve Learned

Here’s a quick review of your new skills:

- The basics of the **C programming language**
- Variables, conditionals, loops, and functions
- How to install the **Pico SDK** and compile C code
- How to upload `.uf2` files to the Raspberry Pi Pico
- How to use **GPIO pins** to control real-world hardware
- How to build a simple **blinking LED circuit**

---

## What You’ve Built

You created a complete hardware/software project:

- C code that runs on a microcontroller
- A functioning circuit with an LED
- A reliable workflow for development and flashing

---

## Where to Go Next

You’ve got a strong foundation — now it’s time to go further:

### Learn More C

- Use structs, arrays, and pointers
- Work with interrupts and timers
- Write reusable header files and libraries

---

### Build More Projects

- Add buttons and read inputs
- Control a buzzer or servo motor
- Interface with sensors (temperature, motion, etc.)
