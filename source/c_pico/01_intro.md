Welcome to **Getting Started with C on the Raspberry Pi Pico**
This course is designed for **absolute beginners** — no programming or electronics experience required.

If you've never written a line of code before, you're in the right place.

---

## What You’ll Learn

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:

- Understand the basics of the **C programming language**
- Write simple C programs from scratch
- Set up your **development environment** to write, compile, and upload code to the Pico
- Control the **GPIO pins** on the Raspberry Pi Pico
- Build your first embedded project: **a blinking LED**

---

## Why C and Why the Pico?

C is one of the **most widely used programming languages** in the world — it powers operating systems, embedded systems, and low-level applications.

The Raspberry Pi Pico is:

- Affordable
- Powerful for its size
- A great platform to learn programming and electronics
- Based on the **RP2040 microcontroller** (dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+)

---

## What You’ll Need

To follow along, you’ll need:

- A Raspberry Pi Pico (or Pico W)
- A USB cable (micro-USB)
- A computer running Windows, macOS, or Linux
- A breadboard (optional, but helpful)
- 1x LED and 1x 330Ω resistor (for the LED project)

We’ll walk through how to install everything you need for coding in C — including the toolchain and the SDK.

## Course Structure

This course is broken into five main parts:

1. **Programming Fundamentals** – Learn the core ideas of C programming
2. **Pico Setup** – Install the tools and run your first C program
3. **GPIO Basics** – Learn how to control physical hardware
4. **Your First Project** – Make an LED blink!
5. **Wrap-up & Next Steps** – Where to go after the course

## Let’s Get Started

In the next section, we’ll introduce you to **the C language** — what it is, how it works, and why it’s still relevant today.
