It's time to bring everything together!  
In this lesson, you‚Äôll build your **first real hardware project**: a blinking LED using the Raspberry Pi Pico and C.

This is the ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù of embedded programming ‚Äî and it's just the beginning.

---

## What You‚Äôll Build

You‚Äôll connect an LED to a GPIO pin and write a C program that blinks it on and off every second.

---

## What You‚Äôll Need

- Raspberry Pi Pico (or Pico W)
- Breadboard (optional)
- 1x LED
- 1x 330Œ© resistor
- Jumper wires

### Wiring the Circuit

1. **GPIO 15** ‚Üí long leg of LED (anode)
2. **Short leg (cathode)** ‚Üí 330Œ© resistor ‚Üí GND

```text

\[Pico GPIO 15] ---\[LED]---\[330Œ©]---\[GND]

```

---

## How It Works

Your program will:

- Set GPIO 15 as an **output**
- Turn the pin **HIGH** (3.3V) to light the LED
- Turn the pin **LOW** (0V) to turn it off
- Repeat the cycle with a 1 second delay

---

## Full Code Example

### `blink.c`

```c
#include "pico/stdlib.h"

int main() {
    const uint LED_PIN = 15;
    gpio_init(LED_PIN);
    gpio_set_dir(LED_PIN, GPIO_OUT);

    while (true) {
        gpio_put(LED_PIN, 1);  // Turn LED on
        sleep_ms(1000);
        gpio_put(LED_PIN, 0);  // Turn LED off
        sleep_ms(1000);
    }
}
```

---

## Build and Upload

1. Create a `CMakeLists.txt` similar to earlier lessons.
2. Compile your project:

    ```bash
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    ```

3. Hold **BOOTSEL**, plug in your Pico
4. Copy the `blink.uf2` file to the **RPI-RP2** drive

üéâ The LED should start blinking!

---

## Try This

- Change the blink timing (try 250ms)
- Blink multiple LEDs on different pins
- Use a `for` loop to blink 10 times, then stop

---

## Summary

You‚Äôve now:

- Built a simple electronic circuit
- Controlled it using C
- Completed your first embedded systems project!
