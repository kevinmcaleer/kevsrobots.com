## Mastering Container Management in Docker

This lesson is designed to equip you with the skills to manage and interact with Docker containers effectively. Understanding container management is key to leveraging Docker's full potential in your development and deployment workflows.

### Starting, Stopping, and Removing Containers

Managing the lifecycle of Docker containers is a fundamental skill for any Docker user. Here's how you can start, stop, and remove containers:

1. **Starting a Container**:
   - Use `docker start [container-name or ID]` to start an existing container.

2. **Stopping a Container**:
   - Stop a running container using `docker stop [container-name or ID]`. This sends a SIGTERM signal, and after a grace period, a SIGKILL signal if the container doesn't stop gracefully.

3. **Removing Containers**:
   - Once a container is stopped, you can remove it with `docker rm [container-name or ID]`.
   - Use `docker rm $(docker ps -a -q)` to remove all stopped containers.

4. **Understanding the Lifecycle**:
   - Docker containers have a lifecycle that begins with their creation, followed by running, pausing, stopping, and finally removal or deletion.

### Inspecting Containers

Getting detailed information about the state and configuration of your containers is crucial for effective container management.

1. **Using `docker inspect`**:
   - The `docker inspect [container-name or ID]` command provides detailed information about a container's configuration and state.

2. **Understanding Container Logs**:
   - Logs are vital for troubleshooting and understanding the behavior of your containers. Use `docker logs [container-name or ID]` to view a container's logs.

3. **Executing Commands Inside Running Containers**:
   - Use `docker exec` to run commands in a running container. For example, `docker exec -it [container-name] bash` opens a bash shell inside the container.

### Logs and Debugging

Properly handling logs and debugging is key to maintaining container health and troubleshooting.

1. **Accessing and Reading Logs**:
   - The `docker logs` command retrieves logs present at the standard output (STDOUT) and standard error (STDERR) from a container.

2. **Debugging Common Container Issues**:
   - Common issues include container crashes, networking issues, or application errors within the container.
   - Use logs, `docker inspect`, and `docker ps -a` (to check container status) for debugging.

3. **Best Practices for Maintaining Container Health**:
   - Regularly check logs and container status.
   - Implement health checks in your Dockerfiles.
   - Keep your containers and their underlying images updated.
