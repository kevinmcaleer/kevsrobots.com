## Introduction to Best Practices

Adopting best practices in using Pydantic with FastAPI not only improves the reliability and efficiency of your applications but also makes your code more readable and easier to maintain.

---

## Structuring Your Project

- **Modularize your Pydantic models:** Organize your models into separate modules or files based on their purpose or domain to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Shared models and utilities:** Place common base models and utility functions in shared modules to avoid duplication and foster reusability.

---

## Model Optimization

- **Use Pydantic's `orm_mode`:** When integrating with ORMs, enable Pydantic models to work with ORM objects by setting `orm_mode = True` in the model's Config class. This allows for more seamless integration with databases.
  
```python
class UserBase(BaseModel):
    username: str
    email: str

    class Config:
        orm_mode = True
```

---

- **Selective field inclusion:** Use Pydantic's `include` and `exclude` to control which fields are included in serialization, reducing payload size and hiding sensitive information.

---

## Validation and Customization

- **Advanced field validation:** Utilize Pydantic's validator decorators for complex validations that go beyond type checks, ensuring data integrity.
- **Custom data types:** Define custom data types for specific fields that require unique validation or transformation, enhancing the robustness of your data handling.

---

## Error Handling

- **Custom error handling:** Implement custom exception handlers in FastAPI to return more informative error responses when Pydantic validation errors occur.

```python
@app.exception_handler(ValidationError)
async def validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: ValidationError):
    return JSONResponse(status_code=400, content={"detail": exc.errors()})
```

---

## Performance Considerations

- **Use Pydantic's `BaseModel` wisely:** While Pydantic models are convenient, overusing them, especially for read-heavy endpoints, can impact performance. Consider alternatives like dataclasses for read-optimized paths.
- **Precompile Pydantic models:** Precompile your models using Pydantic's `create_model` to improve performance in critical code paths.

---

## Lesson Assignment

Review a FastAPI application you've previously developed or create a new simple project. Refactor the application to incorporate the best practices mentioned in this lesson. Focus on model organization, advanced validation, custom error handling, and performance optimization.
