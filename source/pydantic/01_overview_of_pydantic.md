## What is Pydantic?

Pydantic is a data validation and settings management library using Python type annotations. It enables complex data parsing and validation for Python applications, simplifying the process of converting input data into Python data types, validating it, and performing serialization and deserialization.

Developed as an open-source project, Pydantic is widely used in the Python community for creating robust, error-resistant applications. It is particularly popular in web development with FastAPI but is versatile enough for a wide range of applications.
