## Introduction

In addition to the basics, it's also important to familiarize yourself with Python best practices, tips, and tricks. These can help you write more efficient, readable, and Pythonic code. This lesson will introduce you to some of these techniques.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what Pythonic code is.
- Learn about the PEP 8 style guide and the Black code formatter.
- Discover resources for further learning.

### Writing Pythonic Code

`Pythonic code` is a term used to describe code that effectively uses Python idioms and follows widely accepted Python coding conventions. Here are a few examples of Pythonic code:

- Use list comprehensions instead of traditional for loops:

```python
# Non-Pythonic
squares = []
for i in range(10):
    squares.append(i * i)
    
# Pythonic
squares = [i * i for i in range(10)]
```

- Use built-in functions and libraries:

```python
# Non-Pythonic
def reverse_string(s):
    return s[::-1]
    
# Pythonic
from operator import itemgetter
reverse_string = itemgetter(slice(None, None, -1))
```

### PEP 8 and the Black Code Formatter

`PEP 8` is Python's official style guide. It offers recommendations on how to format your code to make it more readable and consistent. Some recommendations include using 4 spaces per indentation level, limiting lines to a maximum of 79 characters, and using whitespace in a way that is visually clear.

[`Black`](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is an uncompromising code formatter for Python. It automatically formats your code to conform to the PEP 8 style guide. It's easy to use, and once you have it set up, you don't have to worry about manually formatting your code anymore.

```shell
# To install Black
pip install black

# To use Black
black your_file.py
```
