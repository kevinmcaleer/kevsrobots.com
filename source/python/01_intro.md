### Your First Python Program

Let's write your first Python program, a classic 'Hello, World!' example:

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

To run this program:

1. Open your IDE or text editor.
1. Copy and paste the code into a new file.
1. Save the file with a `.py` extension, such as `hello_world.py`.
1. Open a terminal/command prompt.
1. Navigate to the directory where you saved `hello_world.py`.
1. Type `python hello_world.py` and press enter to run the program.

You should see `Hello, World!` printed in the terminal.
