### What is Data Visualization?

Data visualization is the graphical representation of data and information. It uses visual elements like charts, graphs, and maps to provide an easy way to understand trends, outliers, and patterns in data.

---

### Introduction to Matplotlib

Matplotlib is a plotting library for Python. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots into applications.

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create a simple line plot
plt.plot([1, 2, 3, 4])
plt.ylabel('Some Numbers')
plt.show()
```

---

### Introduction to Seaborn

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive graphics.

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Load an example dataset
tips = sns.load_dataset("tips")

# Create a simple histogram
sns.histplot(data=tips, x="total_bill")
```

## Summary

In this lesson, you've learned about the basics of data visualization in Python. We've covered the importance of data visualization and explored two Python libraries, Matplotlib and Seaborn, for creating static visualizations. Data visualization is a powerful tool for understanding data and communicating results.
