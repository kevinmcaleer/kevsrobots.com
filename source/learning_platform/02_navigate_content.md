The content is structured in a way that makes sense to the student taking the course.

Related `lessons` are groups by `topic` in a top to bottom structure.

This gives the student the opportunity to jump to specific topics of interest.

The couse structure also lays out the lessons in a cumulative approach, where one lesson will build on the knowledge gained in the previous lessons.

The hierachy is only one level deep, and courses are bite-sized so that you can learn something useful in a single session.
