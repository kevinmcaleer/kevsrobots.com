## Overview

Welcome to the `Data Manipulation with Pandas and NumPy` course! In this course, you will explore how to handle and analyze data efficiently in Python using the powerful libraries [Pandas](/resources/glossary#pandas) and [NumPy](/resources/glossary#numpy). You'll learn about different data structures, how to manipulate and process data, and how to import/export data in various formats.
