Welcome to **Running K3s on Raspberry Pi**!

In this course, you’ll learn how to create a lightweight, fully functional **Kubernetes cluster** using **K3s** — all powered by **Raspberry Pi single-board computers**.

---

## 🚀 What Is K3s?

**K3s** is a lightweight Kubernetes distribution created by Rancher (now part of SUSE). It’s designed for:

- Edge computing
- IoT environments
- Low-resource devices (like Raspberry Pis)

K3s includes all the essential components of Kubernetes, while stripping away features not commonly used outside of large cloud clusters.

## 🍓 Why Use K3s on Raspberry Pi?

| Benefit                     | Why It Matters                        |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Learn Kubernetes         | Build real clusters with real tools    |
| 💡 Low Cost                | Great for budget labs and education    |
| 🌍 Portable & Scalable     | Run anywhere: desk, shed, edge         |
| ⚡ Lightweight              | K3s runs well on 1GB–4GB RAM devices   |
| 🛠️ Real Workloads         | Deploy apps, databases, dashboards     |

---

## 🧰 What You’ll Learn

By the end of this course, you’ll be able to:

- Set up a Raspberry Pi cluster from scratch
- Install and configure K3s
- Add nodes and configure networking
- Deploy and manage real-world apps using Kubernetes
- Set up dashboards, storage, ingress, and CI/CD pipelines
- Secure your cluster for production use

---

## 📦 What You’ll Need

- 2–4 Raspberry Pi 4 or 5 boards (ideally with 2GB+ RAM)
- microSD cards (32GB+ recommended)
- Ethernet cables and switch/router
- Power supply for each Pi
- USB SSDs (optional, but recommended for reliability)
- A separate computer with `ssh` and `kubectl` installed
- Internet access for your cluster

---

## 📋 Course Format

Each lesson in this course builds on the previous one. Lessons include:

- Clear instructions and diagrams
- Code snippets and real terminal commands
- Troubleshooting tips
- Hands-on labs and a final deployment project
