## Creating Your First Drawing

1. **Prepare Your Drawing Surface**:
   - Ensure your drawing surface (wall or board) is clean and the robot is securely mounted.

1. **Run the Script**:
   - Execute the Python script:

     ```sh
     python3 control.py
     ```

1. **Observe the Drawing Process**:
   - Watch as the robot moves the pen to create a basic pattern. Adjust the code for different movements and designs.
