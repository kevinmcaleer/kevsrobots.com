## Introduction to Troubleshooting

As you delve deeper into robotics, encountering challenges is inevitable. Whether itâ€™s hardware malfunctions or software bugs, effective troubleshooting is key to overcoming these hurdles. This lesson covers common issues in robot arm projects and offers strategies for identifying and resolving them.

## Common Hardware Issues

### Servo Motor Problems

- **Symptom:** Servo not moving or jittering
- **Troubleshooting:** Check for loose connections, ensure the power supply is adequate, and verify that the PWM signal is correct. Test with a different servo to rule out hardware failure.

---

### Inadequate Power Supply

- **Symptom:** The robot arm moves erratically or lacks strength.
- **Troubleshooting:** Ensure the power supply meets the required voltage and current specifications. Consider using a separate power supply for the servos to prevent voltage drops.

---

### Mechanical Obstructions

- **Symptom:** Parts of the arm are not moving smoothly or are stuck.
- **Troubleshooting:** Inspect for physical obstructions or misaligned parts. Lubricate joints if necessary and ensure all components are securely fastened.

---

## Common Software Issues

### Incorrect Servo Calibration

- **Symptom:** Servo does not reach desired positions accurately.
- **Troubleshooting:** Recalibrate servo limits in your software. Ensure that your code correctly maps the desired angles to PWM values.

---

### Programming Logic Errors

- **Symptom:** The arm does not perform tasks as expected.
- **Troubleshooting:** Review your code for logical errors. Break down complex sequences into smaller parts and test each independently. Use debugging tools or print statements to track variable values and program flow.

---

### Communication Failures

- **Symptom:** The Raspberry Pi cannot communicate with the PCA9685 board or servos.
- **Troubleshooting:** Check I2C connections and ensure the correct address is used in your code. Use tools like `i2cdetect` to verify communication with the PCA9685 board.

---

## Preventive Measures

- **Regular Maintenance:** Periodically check and maintain your robot arm's mechanical and electrical components.
- **Code Versioning:** Use version control for your software to manage changes and revert to previous working versions if needed.
- **Documentation:** Keep detailed records of your project, including wiring diagrams, component specifications, and software modifications.
