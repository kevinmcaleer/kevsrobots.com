## Course Overview

We'll start with the basics, setting up your Raspberry Pi and getting familiar with Python programming. From there, you'll learn about the PCA9685 boardâ€”a versatile servo driver that allows for precise control over multiple servos simultaneously.

As we progress, you'll dive into the mechanical design and assembly of a 4-servo robot arm. You'll gain hands-on experience in constructing a functional robot arm, from choosing the right materials to assembling the servos and connecting them to the PCA9685 board.
