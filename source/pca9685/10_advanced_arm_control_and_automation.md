## Introduction to Advanced Control Techniques

Having mastered basic movements, it's time to explore more sophisticated programming techniques that can significantly enhance your robot arm's functionality. This lesson will introduce concepts such as automation, loops, conditionals, and sensory input integration, enabling your robot arm to perform tasks with greater intelligence and autonomy.

---

## Automation with Loops

Loops allow your robot arm to perform repeated tasks without manual intervention. For example, you can program the arm to continuously sort objects of different sizes.

```python
def sort_objects():
    while True:  # Infinite loop to keep the arm sorting
        object_size = detect_object_size()
        if object_size == 'large':
            place_in_bin('large')
        else:
            place_in_bin('small')

sort_objects()
```

---

## Making Decisions with Conditionals

Conditionals (if-else statements) enable your robot arm to make decisions based on sensory input or other criteria. This is crucial for tasks requiring adaptability to different scenarios.

```python
def detect_object_size():
    # Simulated function to detect object size
    # Replace with actual sensor code
    return 'large'  # Example return value

def place_in_bin(bin_type):
    # Code to move the arm to the specified bin and release the object
    pass
```

---

## Integrating Sensory Input

Integrating sensors with your robot arm can dramatically increase its capabilities, allowing it to react to its environment. For instance, a distance sensor could enable the arm to detect an object's presence and adjust its grip strength accordingly.

```python
def adjust_grip():
    distance = measure_distance()  # Simulate measuring distance to the object
    if distance < 5:  # If the object is close, adjust grip
        set_servo_position(claw_channel, claw_grip_tight)
    else:
        set_servo_position(claw_channel, claw_grip_loose)
```

## Example: Automated Assembly Line Task

Imagine programming your robot arm for an automated assembly line where it needs to pick up, inspect, and sort items based on size or color.

```python
def assembly_line_task():
    while True:  # Continuous operation
        if detect_item_color() == 'red':
            sort_red_items()
        else:
            sort_blue_items()

# Placeholder functions for demonstration
def detect_item_color():
    return 'red'  # Simulated function

def sort_red_items():
    # Code to sort red items
    pass

def sort_blue_items():
    # Code to sort blue items
    pass
```

## Conclusion

By incorporating advanced programming techniques and sensory input, you can significantly enhance the capabilities of your robot arm, making it more intelligent and autonomous. Experiment with these concepts to discover the full potential of your robotic creation.

## Lesson Assignment

Design and program a task for your robot arm that incorporates loops, conditionals, and at least one type of sensor input. Document the process, including any challenges faced and how you addressed them.
