## Overview

This course will teach you how to model an eye mechanism using Autodesk Fusion 360. The eye mechanism has two eyelids that open and close around a central part using just one servo. You can 3d print the resulting parts and include them in your own robot.

In this course you will learn how to:

* Model a full eye mechanism in Fusion 360
* use the revolve function to create complex parts
* use offset planes
* construct mid-planes
* project a sketch onto a curved surface
* make two parts revolve around a point with the joint function
* animate in Fusion 360
* export each part so it can be 3d printed
