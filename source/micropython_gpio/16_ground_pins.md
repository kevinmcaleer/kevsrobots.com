## What are ground pins?

Ground pins are a type of GPIO pin that is used to complete an electrical circuit. They provide a low-resistance path for electrical current to flow back to the power source, such as a battery or power supply. Without ground pins, circuits would not work properly or at all.

## Identifying ground pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico

The Raspberry Pi Pico has several ground pins that are labeled `GND`. These pins are usually black or brown and are often grouped together with other ground pins. It is important to use the correct ground pins when connecting components to the Pico to ensure proper circuit operation.

## Using ground pins in your circuits

To use ground pins in your circuits, simply connect one end of your component (such as an LED or a resistor) to a GPIO pin and the other end to a ground pin. This will complete the circuit and allow electrical current to flow through the component.

## Summary

In this lesson, you will learn about ground pins on the Raspberry Pi Pico and how to use them in your projects. You will be able to identify ground pins on the board and use them to connect components to your circuits.
