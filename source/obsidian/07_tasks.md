## Tasks in Obsidian

Obsidian makes it easy to manage tasks and to-dos right inside your notes. You can use simple Markdown checkboxes for basic lists, or install plugins for advanced task management.

---

## Creating Tasks with Checkboxes

- To create a task, use `- [ ]` at the start of a line:

```markdown
- [ ] Buy groceries
- [ ] Write blog post
- [ ] Review project notes
```

- To mark a task as complete, change it to `- [x]`:

```markdown
- [x] Buy groceries
```

---

## Viewing and Organizing Tasks

- You can add tasks anywhere in your notes—daily notes, project pages, or meeting logs.
- Use tags (e.g., `#todo`, `#urgent`) to group and filter tasks.

---

## The Tasks Plugin

For more advanced features, install the [Tasks plugin](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks):

- Query tasks across your entire vault
- Filter by tag, due date, or completion status
- Schedule recurring tasks
- View tasks in a dedicated pane

---

**Example query:**

```markdown
```tasks
not done
tag: #urgent
```
```

---

## Tips

- Use daily notes to keep track of what you need to do each day
- Review completed tasks regularly to track your progress
- Combine tasks with links and tags for powerful project management

With Obsidian, you can keep all your tasks and notes in one place—customize your workflow to fit your needs!
