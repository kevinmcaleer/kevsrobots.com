## Tips for Effective Note-Taking

- **Keep notes short and focused:** Create a new note for each topic or idea.
- **Use links:** Connect related notes using `[[note name]]` to build your knowledge network; The note doesn't even have to exist yet!
- **Add tags:** Use tags (e.g., `#project`, `#idea`) to group and find notes easily.
- **Organize with folders:** Group notes by project, topic, or context.

## Deleting Notes
