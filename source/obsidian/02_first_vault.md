## Creating Your First Vault

A **Vault** in Obsidian is simply a folder where all your notes are stored. Each vault is a separate workspace, allowing you to organize different projects or areas of your life.

---

## Steps to Create Your First Vault

1. **Open Obsidian.**
2. On the welcome screen, click **"Create new vault"**.
3. **Name your vault** — choose something meaningful, like "Personal Notes" or "Work Projects".
4. **Choose a location** on your computer where you want your vault folder to be stored.
5. Click **"Create"**.

Obsidian will create the folder and open it as your new workspace.

## Understanding Vault Structure

- Your vault is just a folder on your computer. All your notes (Markdown files), images, and attachments are stored here.
- You can have multiple vaults for different purposes (e.g., work, study, personal).
- Each vault is independent — settings, plugins, and notes are not shared between vaults.

## Adding Your First Note

1. Click the **"New note"** button (new note icon) in the sidebar.
2. Give your note a title, such as "Welcome to Obsidian".
3. Start typing! Your notes are saved automatically as you write.

## Organizing Your Vault

- **Folders:** Create folders to organize your notes by topic or project.
- **Tags:** Add tags to your notes for easy searching and grouping.
- **Links:** Start linking notes together using `[[note name]]` to build your knowledge network.

## Tips

- You can move, rename, or delete notes and folders directly from within Obsidian or using your file manager.
- All your notes are stored as plain Markdown files, so you always have access to your data.

> ## Offline, by default
>
> Obsidian is designed to work offline, storing all your notes locally on your device. This means you can access and edit your notes without an internet connection.
> There are options to synchronize your notes across devices using third-party services like iCloud, Dropbox or Google Drive, but this is not required to use Obsidian effectively.
>
> Obsidian also has a paid `sync` service that allows you to sync your notes across devices seamlessly.
