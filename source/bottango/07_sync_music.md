One of Bottango‚Äôs most powerful features is the ability to **synchronize your animations with music or sound effects**. This is perfect for building animatronics that lip-sync, dance, or react to music in time.

---

## üéµ Step 1: Add an Audio Track

1. Open your Bottango project.
2. In the timeline view, click **Add Audio**.
3. Choose a `.mp3` or `.wav` file from your computer.
4. The audio waveform will appear in the timeline.

> üìù Tip: Use short, high-quality audio clips for best results.

---

## üïí Step 2: Align Keyframes with the Beat

1. Play the audio using the timeline preview.
2. Use the waveform as a visual guide to **place keyframes** at musical beats or lyric changes.
3. You can **zoom in** on the timeline for precise placement.

This makes it easy to time head nods, arm waves, or jaw movements with music.

---

## üóùÔ∏è Step 3: Lip-Syncing Basics

To create a simple lip-sync effect:

- Assign a servo to control the jaw or mouth
- Create quick up/down movements at syllables or beats
- Use easing curves to make the motion look more natural

For more realism, try animating multiple mouth positions (visemes) using multiple servos.

---

## üéõÔ∏è Optional: Use Audio Triggers

If you want animations to start **when audio begins**, create a trigger:

1. Go to the **Triggers** panel.
2. Choose **Audio Starts** as the source.
3. Set the action to **Play Animation** or **Start Timeline**.

You can also sync lighting, gamepad actions, or other animations using audio events.

---

## üîä Output Options

- Bottango plays audio **on your computer**, not on the microcontroller.
- If you‚Äôre using a Bluetooth speaker or need tight timing, test playback latency.
- For installations or stage performances, consider routing audio and animation output through a synced show controller.

---

## üé≠ Example: Dancing Robot

1. Load a short music clip (e.g. 10‚Äì30 seconds).
2. Add servo keyframes to match the beat.
3. Add dramatic motions for chorus or breaks.
4. Use **loop playback** to rehearse and refine.

The result? A robot or puppet that dances in time with the music ‚Äî great for stage props, Halloween decorations, or interactive art.

You've now learned how to animate with rhythm and sound ‚Äî awesome work!

## Try it Yourself

Let's put audio sync into practice! Try these creative exercises:

1. **Beat Matching**: Load a short music clip with a clear beat (5-10 seconds):
   - Add a servo animation that nods or bobs on each beat
   - Use the audio waveform to place keyframes precisely
   - Test with different songs - does it stay in sync?

2. **Simple Lip-Sync**: Record yourself saying "Hello, I am a robot!" (or use a text-to-speech tool):
   - Load the audio into Bottango
   - Create jaw movements that open/close with each syllable
   - Tips: Open jaw on vowels (a, e, i, o, u), close on consonants

3. **Musical Performance**: Choose a 15-second music clip and create a "performance":
   - Servo 1: Moves left-right with melody
   - Servo 2 (if available): Bobs up-down with bass/drums
   - Make big dramatic movements during chorus or crescendos
   - Enable loop playback for rehearsal

4. **Reaction Animation**: Create an animation triggered by audio starting:
   - Set up audio trigger: "When audio starts"
   - Action: Play a "wake up" animation (slow movement to ready position)
   - When audio ends: Return to "sleep" position

**Advanced Challenge**: Create a "talking character" that:
- Has realistic lip-sync with 3+ different mouth positions
- Head nods emphasize certain words
- Eyes blink occasionally (if you have an extra servo)
- Plays back a 20-30 second dialogue clip
