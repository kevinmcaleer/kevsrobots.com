## üéöÔ∏è Step 2: Assign Gamepad Controls

You can assign gamepad inputs to either:

- **Trigger animations** (e.g., press button A to wave)
- **Directly control servo positions** (e.g., move a joystick to control a jaw)

### To trigger an animation:

1. Go to the **Triggers** panel
2. Click **Add Trigger**
3. Choose **Gamepad Button**
4. Select the button (e.g., Button A)
5. Set the action to **Play Animation** and choose your animation

### To control a servo directly:

1. Select your servo in the timeline
2. In the **Servo Settings**, choose **Gamepad Axis** under input method
3. Select the joystick axis (e.g., Left Stick Y)
4. Set the range (min/max) to match your servo's limits

## üß™ Test It Out

- Press your assigned gamepad button ‚Äî the servo should move or play an animation
- Move a joystick ‚Äî the servo should follow your movement in real time

> üéØ You can control multiple servos simultaneously with different axes!

## üß† Creative Uses

- Real-time puppet shows (control eyes, mouth, head)
- Remote-controlled robots with expressive motion
- Assistive tools (e.g., gamepad-controlled grippers)
- Multiplayer animatronic props or characters

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Tips for Smooth Gamepad Control

- Use **easing curves** or filtering for smoother servo movement
- Avoid using the same axis for multiple servos unless needed
- Keep servo limits in mind to avoid jitter or strain

With a gamepad in hand, your project becomes a **live, expressive performer**.
