`Bottango` is a powerful and intuitive motion engine designed to let you **animate servos and other actuators** without writing any code. Whether you're creating a robotic puppet, an animatronic character, or simply want to add motion to your DIY project, Bottango makes it easy to bring your ideas to life.

## üõ†Ô∏è What is Bottango?

Bottango (<https://bottango.com>) is a free application for Windows and Mac that connects to microcontroller boards like **Arduino Uno** or **ESP32**. It gives you a timeline-style editor, similar to animation software, where you can create precise servo movements, add events, and even sync animations to music.

Unlike traditional servo control that requires coding, Bottango provides a **drag-and-drop interface** and real-time playback, making it ideal for beginners and advanced makers alike.

## ü§ñ Why Use Bottango?

Traditional servo control often requires you to:

- Write code
- Upload it to the board
- Recompile for every small change

With Bottango, you:

- Design and test motion in real-time
- Create fluid, lifelike movements
- Add interactivity without a single line of code
