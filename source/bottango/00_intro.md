## Overview

`Bottango` is a powerful and intuitive motion engine designed to let you **animate servos and other actuators** without writing any code. Whether you're creating a robotic puppet, an animatronic character, or simply want to add motion to your DIY project, Bottango makes it easy to bring your ideas to life.

Bottango (<https://bottango.com>) is a free application for Windows and Mac that connects to microcontroller boards like **Arduino Uno** or **ESP32**. It gives you a timeline-style editor, similar to animation software, where you can create precise servo movements, add events, and even sync animations to music.

Unlike traditional servo control that requires coding, Bottango provides a **drag-and-drop interface** and real-time playback, making it ideal for beginners and advanced makers alike.

## Course Content

In this course, you'll explore:

- Installing and configuring Bottango on your computer
- Connecting and setting up microcontroller boards (Arduino, ESP32)
- Wiring servos and understanding power requirements
- Creating smooth motion sequences with the timeline editor
- Using triggers and events for interactive animations
- Syncing servo movements to music and audio
- Controlling animations with gamepads and external inputs
- Building complete animatronic projects from start to finish

---

## Key Results

After completing this course, you'll be able to:

- Set up Bottango with your Arduino or ESP32 board
- Wire and configure servos for precise control
- Create fluid, lifelike animations without writing code
- Build interactive robotic projects with gamepad control
- Sync servo movements to music for performances
- Design and deploy complete animatronic characters

## What you'll need

Here's a list of recommended components to follow along with the course:

- A Windows or Mac computer
- A microcontroller (Arduino Uno, Nano, or ESP32)
- 1â€“3 SG90 or MG90S servos
- USB cable to connect your board
- External power supply (for more than 1 servo)
- Jumper wires and a breadboard (optional)

You'll also need to download Bottango from the official site:
