## Overview

Welcome to `Working with Data`. This course is aimed at people new to MicroPython and programming in general, want to use sensors to read in data and then work with that data. It will take you through each concept step by step, provide examples of ***real code*** and explain ***how*** and ***why*** it works.

## Course Content

In this course you will learn:

* What is the diference between data, information, knowledge and wisdom

## How the course works

New Keywords are introduced and explained, and are highlighted to help emphasise them. 

For example keywords are highlighed inline with the course text like `this`.

Longer examples of code are hightlighted like this:

```python
print('this is an example')
```

Important notes will be highlighted in sections like the two below:

> ## This is a note
>
> Important notes are hightlighted like this

> ## Another aside
>
> Asides are also highlighed in sections, but in an alternative colour
