## Introduction to Boolean Operations

Boolean operations are fundamental in CAD modeling for creating complex forms by combining simpler ones. In FreeCAD, you can use these operations to merge, cut, and intersect 3D shapes. This lesson explains how to use Boolean tools effectively to sculpt your 3D designs.

## Understanding Boolean Tools

1. **Union (Fuse):**
   - Combines two or more objects into one continuous shape, merging their volumes.

2. **Difference (Cut):**
   - Subtracts the volume of one object from another, useful for creating holes or slots.

3. **Intersection (Common):**
   - Generates a shape from the overlapping volume of two objects, useful for creating complex matched interfaces.

## Practical Application of Boolean Operations

### Example Project: Assembling a Simple Toolbox

- **Objective:** Use Boolean operations to assemble a toolbox from individual components.
- **Components:**
  - Base box for the body.
  - Smaller boxes and cylinders for compartments and handle.

---

### Steps to Create the Toolbox

1. **Create the Base:**
   - Use the `Box` tool to create the main body of the toolbox.

2. **Add Compartments:**
   - Create smaller boxes inside the main box for compartments.
   - Use the `Union` operation to fuse them together.

3. **Form the Handle:**
   - Create a cylinder for the handle.
   - Position it on top of the toolbox.
   - Use `Difference` to create slots in the toolbox where the handle attaches, ensuring a snug fit.

4. **Refine the Design:**
   - Apply `Intersection` to any overlapping areas to refine the fit and finish of the toolbox.

## Lesson Assignment

Design and model a birdhouse using Boolean operations. Start with basic shapes to construct the main house and roof. Use the `Difference` operation to create an entrance and ventilation holes. Experiment with `Union` to add additional features like a perch.
