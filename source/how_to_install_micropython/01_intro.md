## About the Raspberry Pi Pico

The Raspberry Pi Pico is a family of microcontrollers developed by the Raspberry Pi Ltd. It is a low-cost, high-performance microcontroller board with flexible digital interfaces. The original Pico was built on the RP2040 microcontroller chip, which features a dual-core ARM Cortex-M0+ processor with 264KB of SRAM and 2MB of flash memory. The Pico is designed to be easy to use and is ideal for a wide range of projects, from simple electronics to complex robotics.

The Pico has 40 pins, also known as General purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins, which can be used to connect to a wide range of sensors, displays, and other devices. We cover how to use the GPIO Pins in a later course - [Raspberry Pi Pico with MicroPython - GPIO Mastery](/learn/micropython_gpio).

In August 2024 the Raspberry Pi Pico 2 was launch, powered by the RP2350 microcontroller chip. This chip features a dual-core ARM Cortex-M33 and also dual-core RISC-V Hazard3 all in the same package with 520KB of SRAM and 4MB of flash memory. The Pico 2 is designed to be even more powerful and versatile than the original Pico, with more memory and processing power for more complex projects.

The Pico is compatible with a wide range of programming languages, including MicroPython, CircuitPython, Rust, and C/C++. It can be programmed using a variety of development environments, including Thonny, Visual Studio Code, and the Arduino IDE. The Pico also features a range of digital interfaces, including I2C, SPI, UART, and PWM, making it easy to connect to a wide range of sensors, displays, and other devices.

Don't worry if those acronyms seem confusing - there are plenty of [tutorials](/learn/learning_pathways/pico) to get you up to speed.
