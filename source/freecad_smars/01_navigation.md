# Navigation in FreeCAD

To move the model around the screen, you can use the following mouse controls:

- **Rotate**: Click and hold the middle mouse button (scroll wheel) and move the mouse.
- **Pan**: Click and hold the middle mouse button (scroll wheel) while holding the `Shift` key, then move the mouse.
- **Zoom**: Scroll the mouse wheel up to zoom in and down to zoom out.

You can also use the navigation cube located in the top right corner of the 3D view to quickly change the view orientation. Clicking on different faces, edges, or corners of the cube will adjust the view accordingly.

Additionally, you can use the following keyboard shortcuts for navigation:
- `1`: Front view
- `2`: Back view
- `3`: Top view
- `4`: Bottom view
- `5`: Left view
- `6`: Right view
- `0`: Isometric view
- `Ctrl + 0`: Fit all objects in the view
- `F`: Focus on the selected object
- `Shift + F`: Focus on all objects in the scene
- `+` and `-`: Zoom in and out incrementally
- `Arrow Keys`: Pan the view in small increments

These controls will help you effectively navigate and manipulate your view within FreeCAD.
