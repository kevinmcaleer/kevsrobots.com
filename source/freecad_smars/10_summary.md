In this series of lessons, we have covered the step-by-step process of modeling the SMARS robot base using FreeCAD. Below is a summary of the key topics we explored:

1. **Creating the Base Shape**: We started by creating the main body of the SMARS robot base, defining its dimensions and overall shape.
2. **Adding Side Holes**: We learned how to add side holes to the base for mounting purposes, using sketches and pocket operations.
3. **Incorporating Arduino Slots**: We explored how to create slots for mounting an Arduino board inside the robot base using the Mirror tool.
4. **Designing Wheel Stubs**: We created wheel stubs for the robot base, utilizing the Polar Pattern tool to efficiently replicate features.
5. **Constructing the Motor Holder**: We designed the motor holder, including cutouts for motor tabs, using sketches and pocket operations.
6. **Exporting for 3D Printing**: Finally, we discussed how to prepare and export the model for 3D printing, ensuring it is ready for fabrication.

Each lesson provided detailed instructions, complete with images and explanations of the tools and techniques used in FreeCAD. By following these lessons, you should now have a solid understanding of how to model complex shapes and features in FreeCAD, specifically tailored to the SMARS robot base design.
