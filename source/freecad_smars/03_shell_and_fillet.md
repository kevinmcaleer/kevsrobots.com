3. Next, we will add fillets to the edges of the base. Click on the `Fillet` button in the toolbar.

    - Select the four vertical edges of the base by clicking on them while holding the `Ctrl` key, also select the four horizontal edges on the bottom face.

    - In the `Fillet` dialog, set the `Radius` value to `4mm` to create rounded edges. Click `OK` to apply the fillets.

4. Next we'll change the thickness of the front and back walls to 2mm.

    - First, select the inside of the front face by clicking on it.

    - Click on the `Thickness` button in the toolbar again.
    - In the `Thickness` dialog, set the `Thickness` value to `1mm` to thin the wall to 1mm. Click `OK` to apply the change.

    - Repeat the same process for the back face of the base. Use the navigation cube to rotate the view and select the inside of the back face.
