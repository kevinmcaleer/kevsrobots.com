In this lesson we'll learn how to export the SMARS robot base as an STL file for 3D printing.

1. First, ensure that the SMARS robot base model is selected in the Model tree.

    ![Select model](assets/stl01.png){:class="img-fluid w-100"}

2. Next, click on the `File` menu in the top left corner of FreeCAD.

    ![File menu](assets/stl02.png){:class="img-fluid w-100"}

3. From the dropdown menu, select `Export...`.

    ![Export option](assets/stl03.png){:class="img-fluid w-100"}

4. In the file dialog that appears, navigate to the folder where you want to save the STL file.

    - In the `Save as type` dropdown, select `STL Mesh (*.stl)`.

    ![Select STL type](assets/stl04.png){:class="img-fluid w-100"}

5. Enter a name for your STL file, such as `smars_robot_base.stl`, and click the `Save` button.
