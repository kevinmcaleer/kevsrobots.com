## What is ROS?

Here is the definition from the creators of ROS - <https://ros.org/>

> *"The Robot Operating System (ROS) is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From drivers to state-of-the-art algorithms, and with powerful developer tools, ROS has what you need for your next robotics project. And it's all open source."*

## Which version should I use

There are two versions of ROS:

* **ROS** - The original version of ROS
* **ROS2** - The latest version of ROS - this is what we will be using, as the older version is depreciated.

## Programming languages

ROS2 Supports both `C++` and `Python` out of the box (and I'm sure there are other languages adapted to use it too), however for this course we will be focusing on `Python`.
