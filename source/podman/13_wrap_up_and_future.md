Congratulations! 🎉 You've completed the **From Docker to Podman** course.

You’ve learned how Podman works, why it’s a compelling alternative to Docker, and how to migrate and run your container-based workflows with more flexibility, control, and security.

---

## ✅ What You’ve Learned

- **Podman vs Docker architecture** — daemonless, rootless, secure
- **Installing Podman** across Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Using the Podman CLI** to manage containers, images, and volumes
- **Unique Podman features** like pods, systemd integration, and Kubernetes support
- **Working with podman-compose** and converting Docker Compose files
- **Running Podman in production** with systemd and logs
- **Debugging and troubleshooting** container issues
- **Migrating a real-world app** from Docker to Podman

---

## 🔮 Where Podman Fits in the Future

Podman is part of a broader shift toward:

- **Rootless, user-space containerization**
- **Kubernetes-native development workflows**
- **Modular tooling** (e.g., Buildah, Skopeo, CRI-O)
- **Daemonless security models** for multi-tenant environments

As containers evolve, Podman’s lightweight, standards-based approach is likely to become even more relevant.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

Want to take your skills further? Here’s what you can explore next:

- 🛠 **Learn Buildah**: For advanced image building pipelines
- 📦 **Explore Skopeo**: For copying, verifying, and signing container images
- ⚙️ **Run containers with systemd timers**: Automate periodic jobs
- ☁️ **Integrate with Kubernetes**: Use `podman generate kube` and `podman play kube`
- 🔄 **Transition to CRI-O**: Run production Kubernetes workloads using Podman-compatible infrastructure
