## Overview

Welcome to the BurgerBot course! BurgerBot is a fun, affordable robot platform perfect for learning robotics, MicroPython programming, and 3D printing. This hands-on course guides you through assembling a burger-shaped robot from 3D-printed parts, then programming it to move autonomously and avoid obstacles.

BurgerBot is designed to be beginner-friendly while teaching real robotics concepts. The robot uses a Raspberry Pi Pico for its brain, two micro metal motors for movement, and an ultrasonic rangefinder for detecting objects. By the end of this course, you'll have a fully functional robot that can navigate autonomously, draw patterns, and even follow lines!

The best part? All the chassis parts are 3D printable, making this an accessible and customizable robotics platform. Whether you're new to robotics or looking for a fun weekend project, BurgerBot is the perfect place to start.

## How the course works

This course combines hands-on hardware assembly with MicroPython programming. You'll physically build your robot first, then progressively learn to control it with code.

**What to expect in each lesson:**

- **Step-by-step instructions** - Clear, numbered steps with images
- **Working code examples** - Copy and run immediately in Thonny IDE
- **Video tutorials** - Visual guides for complex assembly steps
- **Troubleshooting tips** - Solutions to common problems
- **Interactive challenges** - Practice exercises to test your skills

**Learning approach:**

1. **3D Print** - Print the chassis parts (or order pre-printed)
2. **Assemble** - Put together motors, electronics, and printed parts
3. **Install** - Set up MicroPython on Raspberry Pi Pico
4. **Code** - Learn to control motors and sensors with Python
5. **Navigate** - Implement autonomous movement and object avoidance
6. **Upgrade** - Add advanced features like drawing and line following

Each lesson builds on the previous one. The course uses the BurgerBot library to simplify robot control while teaching fundamental robotics concepts.

> **Note:** All code is written in MicroPython for Raspberry Pi Pico. You can copy code directly from lessons or download complete files from the linked GitHub repositories.

## Prerequisites

This course is beginner-friendly! You don't need prior experience with:
- Robotics or robot building
- MicroPython programming (we'll teach you!)
- 3D printing (basic familiarity helpful)

**Helpful (but not required):**
- Basic Python knowledge - see [Python for Beginners](/learn/python/)
- Familiarity with Raspberry Pi Pico - see [Getting Started with Pico](/learn/pico/)
- Understanding of basic electronics

If you're completely new to MicroPython, you might want to check out our [Learn MicroPython - The Basics](/learn/micropython/) course first, but it's not required - we'll guide you through everything!
