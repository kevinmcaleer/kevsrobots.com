## Welcome to build your own burgerbot course

Welcome to this course on building and programming `Burgerbot`!

`Burgerbot` is a fun and engaging robot that can move around and avoid objects using a range finder.

In this course, you will create a burgerbot step by step by assembling your own `Burgerbot`, including the Pico lipo shim, motor holders, range finder, and more. You will also create and load it onto the robot using MicroPython.

The course will cover basic movement and using the range finder to avoid objects. You will add a pen to your robot to enable it to draw, as well as a line following module and swap out the range finder for a camera. By the end of this course, you will have a fully functional `Burgerbot` that you can program to move and interact with its environment in creative ways. So let's get started!
