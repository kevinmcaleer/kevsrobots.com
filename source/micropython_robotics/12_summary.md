## ✅ What You’ve Learned

By completing this course, you’ve gained experience with:

- Controlling DC motors using H-bridge drivers
- Reading input from IR and ultrasonic sensors
- Programming autonomous and reactive behaviors
- Mounting and wiring a two-wheeled robot chassis
- Using a servo to scan the environment
- Adding remote control via Bluetooth and Wi-Fi
- Building and testing a complete robotics project

## 🚀 What’s Next?

Here are some ways you can take your skills further:

### 🔧 Build Smarter Robots
- Add encoders to track distance and speed
- Explore PID control for smoother motion
- Experiment with multiple sensor types (light, temperature, compass, etc.)

### 🧠 Add Logic and AI
- Use conditionals to make more complex decisions
- Try micropython libraries for machine learning at the edge
- Implement basic mapping or obstacle memory

### 🕸️ Connect to the Cloud
- Send sensor data to a web dashboard
- Control your robot over the internet
- Log your robot’s movements for analysis

### 🤖 Explore Other Microcontrollers
- Try MicroPython on ESP32 or other boards
- Compare features and performance
- Use additional hardware like cameras or GPS modules
