## How the course works

New Keywords are introduced and explained, and are highlighted to help emphasise them. 

For example keywords are highlighed inline with the course text like `this`.

Longer examples of code are hightlighted like this:

```python
print('this is an example')
```

Important notes will be highlighted in sections like the two below:

> ## This is a note
