MicroPython is ***easier to write***, ***cleaner*** and ***clearer to read***, and ***faster to get the results you want***, than other languages such as C++.

Compare these two examples below. 

First is a piece of code written for the `Arduino` in `C++`:

## C++

```C
#include <iostream>

void main() {
  std::cout << "hello world";
}
```

The second piece of code is written in `MicroPython`:

## MicroPython

```python
  print(â€œhello world)
```

As you can see, the MicroPython code is simpler, easier to read, shorter and faster to write.
