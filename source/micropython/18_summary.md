This section also introduced you to loops including the `for` and `while` loops. You also learned about all the types of operators that there are, with examples for each.

---

### Functions and Modules

In this section you learned about writing functions, the REPL for entering code directly on the MicroPython board, and finally modules for enhanching your programs even further.
