`MicroPython` is a smaller version of the programming language `Python`, designed for use with MicroControllers: `Micro` + `Python`

`Python` gets it name from a TV show...
> “When he began implementing Python, Guido van Rossum was also reading the published scripts from ‘Monty 
> Python’s Flying Circus’, a BBC comedy series from the 1970s. Van Rossum thought he needed a name that was 
> short, unique, and slightly mysterious, so he decided to call the language Python”
