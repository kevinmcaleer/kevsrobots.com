## The REPL

MicroPython has an input and output console thats called the `REPL`, which stands for Read Evaluation Print Loop. This is because the `REPL` reads in commands, evaluates them, prints out the results and then loops back to the reading in stage.

You will have noticed the `REPL` at the bottom of the screen, its where we see the output of all the code we've run so far.

You can type MicroPython code directly into the `REPL`, which is useful for quickly testing things or examining the attached MicroPython device.
