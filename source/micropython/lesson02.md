Visit <www.micropython.org> for the latest version, documentation and tutorials.

On the MicroPython website, there is a link to Downloads. There is a build of MicroPython for almost all types of MicroController - as long as the MicroController is capable of running MicroPython, which requires a 32bit processor.

To make installing MicroPython easier you can use Thonny - which is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Python and MicroPython. To download Thonny, go <https://www.thonny.org> and download the version your computer.
