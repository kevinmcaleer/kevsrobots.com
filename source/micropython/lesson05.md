Lets create a simple program that will display the message ‘Hello World’[^1].

First, here is the code, type this into your Python editor:

```python
print ('Hello World!')
```

When we run this, we will see the following printed to our screen (also refered to as the console):

``` bash
Hello World!
```
As you can see this is a very simple piece of code. The word `print` is a special word that Python understands. Python expects a line of text between the brackets, inside of the speech marks.

Notice that the `print` command is in lowercase; typing `Print` or `PRINT` will result in an error message.

We call this case sensitive; we need to ensure that the commands we type are in the correct case for Python to work properly.
