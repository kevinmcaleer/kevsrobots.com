title: Why use MicroPython?
description: It's designed to be easy to read and write, perfect for beginners

MicroPython is easier to write, cleaner and clearer to read, and faster to get the results you want, than other languages such as C++.

Compare these two examples below. First is a piece of code written for the Arduino in C++:

```C
#include “stdio.h”
void helloWorld() {
  printf(“hello world”);
}
void main() {
  helloWorld();
}
```

The second piece of code is written in MicroPython:

```python
def hello_world():
  print(“hello world)

hello_world()
```

As you can see, the MicroPython code is simpler, easier to read, shorter and faster to write.
